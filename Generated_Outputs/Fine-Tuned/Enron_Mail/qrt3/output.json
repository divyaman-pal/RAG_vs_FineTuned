The indemnification language is particularly troubling because it \nrequires the contractor to assume the risk of something happening without \nany compensation if there is an accident/failure.  This would be true even if \nthe failure was caused by the Owner.  The owner should be responsible for all \nof its own risks, and a contractor should only be responsible for those \nactivities which it performs for the owner.  I know that our legal counsel \n(Melanie) has expressed significant concern over the current version of the \ncontract (which includes the indemnity).  There are several other areas of \nconcern as well.  We should have time to discuss this during the meeting.  \nHowever, I do not believe that we can accept such terms.\n\nI am also concerned that the contract appears to place undue responsibility \nfor the design of the plant upon the contractor.  The owner and the \ncontractor should each perform their respective roles, but I think that the \ncontractor should provide more input into the design than it currently does.\n\nPlease let me know when you are available to discuss these matters.\n\nThanks,\n\nBill Williams\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom:  \"Gary C.

Bob and I are going to think about what we can do\nto help you out.\n\nAs far as the draft goes, I thought it was a fine start, but it would be\nhelpful if someone could explain what we want the transfer to accomplish.\nIt seems that there are two different ways to look at it:\n\n1.  We want to give ABN a security interest in our turbine equipment so that\nABN can enforce their claim against us should we default.  In this case,\nwe would need an assignment from Enron Corp., and perhaps an assignment\nfrom ECTRIC.  This arrangement is similar to what Enron Corp. did for\nDabhol.\n\n2.  We want to have the transfer recorded in Indiana so that we can have a\nrecorded lien on our turbine equipment.  In this case, we would need an\nassignment from ABN, which would be problematic since they don't own the\nequipment yet.  But we could probably do this by recording an assignment\nfrom ABN to us after the sale.\n\nThe second scenario seems more likely to me, but I would appreciate some\nthought from you and Bob.\n\nI'll try to call you tomorrow morning before noon.\n\nThank you,\n\nKay\n\n(See attached file: Dabhol Transfer Agreement.doc)\n\n\n\n                    \"Stephen\n                    Thome\"               To:     \"'kay.mann@enron.com'\"\n<kay.mann@enron.com>, \"Bob Williams\"      cc:     \"Robert.Williams@enron.com\"\n                    <Stephen.Thome@       <Bob.Williams@enron.com>\n                    jonesday.com>          Subject:     Re: Purchase of\nTurbines\n                    Date:             Wednesday, May 09, 2001 3:53 PM\n                    Organization:   Stephen Thome\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay,\n\nThank you for the opportunity to review the latest version of the\nTransfer Agreement with you yesterday.

The fact that these proposals are currently being considered by the governor and the legislature means that we must tread very carefully in offering our views.  We should reserve comment until the situation has been clarified.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDasovich, Jeff  \nSent:\tWednesday, September 05, 2001 10:41 AM\nTo:\tShapiro, Richard; Kitchen, Louise\nSubject:\tFW: Enron's California Response\nImportance:\tHigh\n\nRichard/Louise:\n\nAs you know, the CA PUC recently proposed a new rate structure to address the state's current energy crisis.  According to the proposal, rates would increase to 15% of current prices as soon as the PUC is able to do so.  They further propose increasing rates to 25% of current prices within six months, and then increasing them to 35% of current prices within another six months.  As the PUC describes it, this is intended to bring prices down to \"cost plus\" levels.  In theory, it seems like this could work -- particularly since, according to the PUC, prices are expected to drop significantly once demand is reduced.  However, in practice, we believe that this approach has some serious problems.\n\nFirst, this approach assumes that the regulatory agency knows better than the market how to set prices.  That assumption is simply wrong.  For example, the PUC has already shown itself unable to predict demand.  And even if it were able to get rates right, the likelihood of success would be slim because the PUC doesn't have the tools at its disposal to quickly move rates up when the market gets it wrong.  In particular, the PUC can't cut rates without legislative approval, and there is no indication that legislators will be willing to help.  Therefore, if the PUC sets rates too low, they won't be able to raise them high enough fast enough.  This would put a tremendous burden on consumers, who would have to absorb much of the shortfall themselves.\n\nSecond, the PUC's plan assumes that the market is failing to accurately reflect supply and demand conditions.  But this assumption is simply false.  The problem isn't one of supply and demand -- it's one of risk and reliability.  In other words, customers are paying higher prices because they fear they will lose power in the event of a blackout.  In addition, suppliers are asking for premium pricing because they worry about having their contracts terminated by utilities during bankruptcy proceedings.  And both sides are justified in their concern.  Therefore, unless the state takes steps to deal with the risk issues, customers and generators will continue to ask for higher prices.  It's also worth pointing out that the risks that customers face are real and substantial, not hypothetical.  These risks include the following:\n\t\t*\tThe possibility that the state's utilities will go bankrupt and be forced into receivership, leaving the state with the burden of providing backup generation capacity to insure reliable service.",

The formation of EPCSC was driven by our desire to develop a more proactive approach to managing risks associated with our global business activities.  We have assembled an experienced team that possesses a unique blend of skills including insurance broking, underwriting, claims handling, risk management, accounting and legal expertise.\n\nIn addition to servicing Enron's worldwide property and casualty exposures, we provide these services to third party clients.  Our initial focus will be on Enron affiliated companies; however, over time we anticipate expanding our client base to include other corporations both domestically and internationally.  Please visit our website (http://www.epcs.enron.com) for additional information about our organization.\n\nThe Enron Board of Directors approved the formation of EPCSC effective January 1st.  As part of its responsibilities, EPCSC will report to and work closely with Enron's Corporate Treasury group.  This organizational structure enables Enron to optimize the value derived from its risk management programs through greater coordination between the various disciplines involved in developing and executing effective risk mitigation strategies.\n\nWe look forward to working with each of you and appreciate your support and cooperation.

The order was issued at the request of the state of Arizona which had filed a complaint alleging that PG&E owned the lines but failed to notify FERC as required under federal law. \n\nThe two transmission lines in question are the Apache Trails Transmission Line and the Pima Interconnect Transmission Line. PG&E owns both facilities through its subsidiary, Topock Energy Project Company. The lines were constructed by PGEO and then purchased by PGEO from the Salt River Project. In October 2000, PGEO transferred the lines to TEPCO, which in turn sold them to PGEO. At the same time, TEPCO acquired the right to operate the lines for PGEO. In April 2001, TEPCO entered into an agreement with PGEO to continue operating the lines for five years. \n\nPG&E argued that the transfer of the line from TEPCO to TEPCO was not \"acquisition\" because there was no change in ownership. However, FERC rejected this argument and concluded that the \"transfer was merely a vehicle for effecting control.\" \n\nThe Commission also held that PGEO must apply to FERC for authority to exercise control over the lines even though PGEO already holds an exemption certificate to construct, own and operate the lines. \n\nAccording to the order, PGEO is currently negotiating with TEPCO regarding the possibility of acquiring control over these lines. FERC indicated that if PGEO fails to obtain TEPCO's consent to the transfer of control, the Commission would seek to compel T",

The order makes clear that the utility-customer relationship is\ncentral to a resolution of this matter and that any remedy must be based on\nthat relationship.  As such, the Commission directs that the parties work\nwith the CPUC to develop an appropriate framework for proceeding forward.\n\nThe Commission also expresses some concern about the prospects for a voluntary\nagreement between the utilities and their customers and makes reference to our\ncomments indicating that it should consider whether it should take over\nnegotiations itself if the parties cannot reach agreement.  However, I am\nconfident that the parties will reach an agreement and that the process can\nbe wrapped up quickly once they do so.\n\nAs to the substance of the order, it recognizes the significant progress\nmade by the utilities toward meeting their obligations under the Commission's\nFebruary 9th order but states that additional measures are still needed.\nSpecifically, the order requires the utilities to submit revised tariffs to\naddress several items:\n\n1.\tImplementation of demand-side management programs;\n2.\tProvisions to allow consumers to reduce their energy usage during peak\nperiods without incurring charges for doing so;\n3.\tCredits for large customers whose energy use is reduced below the level\nrequired to meet their obligation to serve load growth (i.e., the \"negative\nload\" credit);\n4.\tA systemwide rate schedule for residential consumers;\n5.\tReimbursements for costs associated with the restructuring of retail\nservice markets.\n\nThe order also requires the utilities to provide a plan to address the issue\nof the shortfall in funds to cover the undercollections and related credits\nfor non-residential customers.  In addition, the order instructs the utilities\nto submit a plan to address the issue of providing refunds to customers for\ncosts imposed as a result of unbundling.\n\nThe order also addresses the issue of third party generation.  It appears to\ndirect the CPUC to establish the conditions under which third parties can sell\npower into the state marketplace.

The meeting was a success with good attendance, food, and entertainment.  All of the feedback we received was very positive, which is always nice to hear.  The only negative comments were about the length of time it took for the food to be served (this is not something you can control), but all of the attendees said they had plenty of time to eat before the meeting started.  The following are some of the highlights from the meeting:\n\n\tThe first half of the meeting was spent on discussion regarding the Enron Company Announcement.  This announcement will be issued on Wednesday March 6th during a conference call with members of the executive committee and management.  There was also discussion concerning how to communicate this announcement internally.  It was decided that an email would be sent out immediately after the announcement is made via the conference call to inform employees of what has transpired.  The contents of this email should be as brief as possible.  In addition, a \"town hall\" type meeting will be held on Thursday March 7th from 11:30 am until 1:00 pm in the Hyatt Regency Houston.  Employees are encouraged to attend this meeting if their schedules allow so they can get more details concerning the new organization.\n\n\tThe second half of the meeting focused on the proposed changes to the SAP Project Management Team.  As discussed previously, the current team consists of the following individuals:\n\n\tJeff Skilling, Chairman & CEO;\n\tMichael McConnell, EVP & CFO;\n\tJanet Dietrich, SVP/Controller;\n\tDavid Oxley, EVP & CIO;\n\tGreg Whalley, EVP & COO;\n\tLarry Lawyer, SVP & General Counsel;\n\tMike Jordan, SVP & Treasurer;\n\tHunter Shively, EVP & President Global Markets;\n\tKenneth Lay, Executive Chairman.\n\n\tAfter reviewing the list above, it was determined that the EVP's who serve on the PMO do not have sufficient responsibilities to warrant their inclusion on the team.  The following EVP's will no longer be represented on the team:\n\n\tHunter Shively, EVP & President Global Markets\n\tKenneth Lay, Executive Chairman\n\n\tThe PMO will now consist of the following individuals:\n\n\tJeff Skilling, Chairman & CEO\n\tMichael McConnell, EVP & CFO\n\tJanet Dietrich, SVP/Controller\n\tDavid Oxley, EVP & CIO\n\tGreg Whalley, EVP & COO\n\tLarry Lawyer, SVP & General Counsel\n\tMike Jordan, SVP & Treasurer\n\n\tThis change will become effective upon the completion of the company announcement on March 6th.\n\n\tIf anyone has any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me at x54080.\n\nVickie Weldon\nManager\nEnron Corp. - Office of the Chairman\nExt. 31963\nvickie.weldon@enron.com\n\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (",

This will need to be agreed with HR and Legal and should be documented in writing.\n\nThe process should include:\n\na) A meeting between the reviewer and the employee to discuss the performance review feedback. The reviewer should provide written feedback. \nb) An opportunity for the employee to respond to any feedback they do not agree with. They may want to add their own feedback from their perspective or dispute the feedback provided by the reviewer.\nc) A meeting with HR who will review the overall rating for the employee and take into account the performance management system and other information such as risk control testing results etc. \nd) An opportunity for the employee to respond to anything which has been raised during the process. \ne) Feedback session with the reviewer where all feedback will be presented to the employee. The reviewer will also outline the criteria used for each rating and explain why it was given.\nf) The employee will be asked to sign off the document at the end of the process.\n\nAny issues which arise during the process can be addressed immediately. The process will allow for feedback to be given and received by both parties throughout the process.\n\nIf an employee wishes to challenge the outcome of the process then this would be dealt with through the normal grievance procedure.\n\nThe process should cover all employees regardless of whether they are exempt or non-exempt.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nShona\n\n\n\n\n << File: pprc.doc >> \n\nRegards,\nShona Wilson\nDirector of Risk Operations\nGlobal Risk Operations\n(713) 853-5620\nshona.wilson@enron.com\n\n\n\n\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>\n<Em",

The only caveat is that the\nEnron-Reliant agreement requires a specific \"marking\" or identification in\nthe contract which specifies what the terms are for that particular\ncontract.   In other words, if you have an existing contract with Reliant\nand want to switch over to the GTC, then you need to add language in the\nexisting contract to identify what the terms will be under this new\nagreement (in addition to what is specified in the GTC).\n\nI would be happy to work with you on that process.

As we work through these issues, it is important that you continue to receive your natural gas service while you wait for resolution of these matters.  This notice describes how your account will be billed during the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nFirst, you will still receive your monthly bill for natural gas used during November and December even though PG&E filed for bankruptcy on December 3.  Your current rate schedule will apply until new rates are established by the California Public Utilities Commission (\"CPUC\").  You should pay your bill as usual.\n\nSecond, if you were enrolled in a prepayment plan or budget billing program prior to November 1, 2001, the CPUC has ordered PG&E to suspend those programs until further order from the court or the CPUC.  Therefore, you will not be charged any additional amounts under such plans until further notice.\n\nThird, the CPUC has also ordered PG&E to continue to provide full credit and collection protections under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.  Accordingly, PG&E will not report to the credit reporting agencies any information related to delinquent accounts or collections actions taken against you after October 31, 2001, unless specifically authorized by the bankruptcy court.\n\nFinally, PG&E will continue to make customer service available at its regular telephone numbers.  A list of customer service phone numbers appears below.",

We will still \nhave significant capital requirements for growth and therefore require the \nfinancing that we proposed in the original plan.\n\nI look forward to discussing this further.\n\nRegards\nChris\nPhone: +44(0)207 825 2230\nMobile: +44(0)791 457 8230\nemail: cdougher@enron.co.uk <mailto:cdougher@enron.co.uk>\n\n\n\n\n - DW_BP_0001.doc\n - DW_BP_0002.doc\n - DW_BP_0003.doc\n - DW_BP_0004.doc\n - DW_BP_0005.doc\n - DW_BP_0006.doc\n - DW_BP_0007.doc\n - DW_BP_0008.doc\n - DW_BP_0009.doc\n - DW_BP_0010.doc\n - DW_BP_0011.doc\n - DW_BP_0012.doc\n - DW_BP_0013.doc\n - DW_BP_0014.doc\n - DW_BP_0015.doc\n - DW_BP_0016.doc\n - DW_BP_0017.doc\n - DW_BP_0018.doc\n - DW_BP_0019.doc\n - DW_BP_0020.doc\n - DW_BP_0021.doc\n - DW_BP_0022.doc\n - DW_BP_0023.doc\n - DW_BP_0024.doc\n - DW_BP_0025.doc\n - DW_BP_0026.doc\n - DW_BP_0027.doc\n - DW_BP_0028.doc\n - DW_BP_0029.doc\n - DW_BP_0030.doc\n - DW_BP_0031.doc\n - DW_BP_0032.doc\n - DW_BP_0033.doc\n - DW_BP_0034.doc\n - DW_BP_0035.doc\n - DW_BP_0036.doc\n - DW_BP_0037.doc\n - DW_BP_0038.doc\n - DW_BP_0039.doc\n - DW_BP_0040.doc\n - DW_BP_0041.doc\n - DW_BP_0042.doc\n - DW_BP_0043.doc\n - DW_BP_0044.doc\n - DW_BP_0045.doc\n - DW_BP_0046.doc\n - DW_BP_0047.doc\n - DW_BP_0048.doc\n - DW_BP_0",

Thanks!\n\nBest regards,\nSarah\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom:  Kaminski, Vince J  \nSent: Tuesday, June 19, 2001 3:45 PM\nTo: Shackleton, Sara\nCc: Rohauer, Tanya; Zipper, Andy; Leff, Dan\nSubject: RE: EnronOnline - Credit Risk Policy and Guidelines\n\nSara,\n\nAs we discussed on the phone, I would like to propose that we should adopt the \nfollowing policy with respect to credit exposure.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to introduce the concept of \"Credit Exposure\" as \na percentage of the total amount of deals in place, which is calculated as:\n\nCE = (total amount of outstanding deals / total number of deals) * 100\n\nIf this number is above 10%, then it will trigger our standard procedures for \ncredit review.\n\nThe reason why I am proposing such a procedure is the following. We are \ncurrently in a situation where we have a large number of deals under \nnegotiation and we do not know what the credit quality of these counterparties \nwill be when they start trading. By having the percentage of outstanding \ndeal amount above 10% we will be able to identify quickly the credit risk of \nour trading partners. In case the CE exceeds 10% we can take the necessary \naction (e.g., credit approval process) to protect the company's interest.\n\nSecondly, I would like to introduce the concept of \"Credit Threshold\". This \nis a percentage below 10% that will define the level of exposure below which \nwe do not need to perform any credit review. In other words, if the number of \noutstanding deals is lower than the threshold we will consider this a low \nrisk activity and will not ask for additional information from the counterparty \nor perform any type of analysis to verify their financial strength. The \nthreshold will depend on several factors including, but not limited to, the \ncredit rating of the counterparty, the amount of transactions per day, etc.\n\nThirdly, the credit thresholds will be periodically revised based on market \nconditions and company's needs.\n\nI hope you find this proposal acceptable. Please let me know if you have any \nquestions.\n\nVince\n\n\n\n\n\nSara Shackleton@ECT\n06/19/2001 11:24 AM\nTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT, Andy Zipper, \nDan Leff/HOU/EES\ncc:  \nSubject: EnronOnline - Credit Risk Policy and Guidelines\n\nGreetings All:\n\nWe met today regarding the development of EnronOnline's new credit risk \npolicies.  The meeting was very productive and generated some excellent \nideas.  I have attached my notes from the meeting.  Also, I have listed below \nsome additional questions and answers that were raised during the course of \nthe meeting.\n\nPlease note:  the following items are only preliminary and subject to change.  \nThey are meant solely to serve as a starting point for discussion.\n\n1.  Regarding the calculation of credit exposure, we agreed that it should be \ncalculated by taking the sum of the dollar amounts of each open deal and \ndividing that number by the total number of open deals.  As an example, if \nthere are 10 deals, 9 of them worth $100 each, and one worth $1 million, the \ncalculation would be as follows:\n\n$900,000 + $1,000,000 = $1,900,000\n\n$1,900,000 divided by 10 = $190,000\n\nTherefore, the credit exposure would be equal to 19%.\n\n2.  We also agreed that a minimum threshold of 10% should be used.  However, \nwe will monitor the number of transactions and make adjust",

As I mentioned, we have been\nworking with Enron on this issue for some time now.  We have always taken\nthe position that under the terms of the power purchase agreement between\nEnron and LADWP, the City has the right to assign its interest in such\nagreement to a successor city without requiring approval from Enron.  As I\nsaid in my e-mail to you last night, we were not aware that the City was\nactually negotiating an assignment agreement with another city until the\nother day when we learned about the assignment from Enron.  At that point,\nwe began to work with Enron to determine whether the other city had the\nrights to take over the City's obligations under the power purchase\nagreement.\n\nIn fact, we recently completed our review of the agreement and concluded that\nthe other city does indeed have the rights to assume the City's duties\nunder the power purchase agreement.  In order to complete the documentation\nfor the transfer of these rights, we asked Enron to draft a document which\nwould assign the City's interest in the power purchase agreement to the new\ncity.  It appears that we may have left out one important component of the\nassignment agreement -- namely, a requirement that the City give Enron a\nconsent to assign its interests under the power purchase agreement.  We do\nnot believe that this consent is necessary because the City's rights under\nthe power purchase agreement are limited to those rights which are\nexpressly granted in the agreement itself.\n\nWe have not yet determined how we will handle this issue but are planning to\ndiscuss it further with En",

The following are my questions based upon the information that I have received thus far.  As I receive additional information, I will update my questions.\n\nWhat does it mean for Enron to be designated as a market participant?  Is it necessary to file an application with FERC to obtain market participant status?  What is the timeline for obtaining market participant status?  Do we need to take any action today?\n\nAre there any regulatory restrictions on our ability to purchase PX credits from other generators (such as APS)?  Will we face any challenges if we want to sell power into the California market through a separate affiliate (for example, Enron North America sells power to Calpine) and then buy credit for those sales from another entity (such as EES)?\n\nCan we use the PX system to offset losses in the California market (i.e., to sell our power into Nevada where we may make more money than what we lose in California)?\n\nWill the PX credit system work well enough for us to hedge our entire exposure under the current contracts?\n\nIf we do decide to terminate our existing contracts and enter into new contracts with other suppliers, how long will it take to execute these transactions?  What will it cost us to terminate these contracts early?  What will be our potential liability under the new contracts?\n\nWhat impact would it have on our business if California were to deregulate its wholesale electricity market tomorrow?  What would it cost us to exit our existing positions?\n\nShould we be concerned about the possibility of price caps being imposed in California?\n\nWill FERC permit us to purchase power directly from a utility instead of going through a third party marketer?  Are there any restrictions on our ability to provide financial guarantees or collateral to support transactions?\n\nHow does this affect our ability to bid for capacity in the future?  Can we still bid on capacity even though we can no longer do so for incremental energy?\n\nWe will follow up with you as soon as possible after we get answers to these questions.\n\nThanks again,\n\nKen\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMigden, Janine  \nSent:\tThursday, July 20, 2001 10:55 AM\nTo:\tLay, Kenneth\nSubject:\tFERC Order on California\nImportance:\tHigh\n\nAttached is the FERC order regarding California.

The net booked revenue for the month was about $10.9 million.  This amount includes the sale of the physical power generation assets for about $45 million.  Our traders did a good job by realizing over $40 million dollars in the last four months.  In order to continue this success, there are several things that need to be addressed.  First, we need to make sure that the schedulers, traders and risk managers work as a team and communicate with each other.  It is unacceptable to see deals scheduled to deliver into San Diego when we have no position to cover them.  Secondly, we need to make sure that the scheduling staff is properly trained.  We also need to make sure that the traders understand what their responsibilities are and they do not exceed them.  For example, it is not acceptable to tell your schedulers to sell a deal at a certain price, then back out of that deal because you want to get a better price.  Thirdly, we need to make sure that all positions are sold every day.  Fourthly, we need to make sure that the traders are properly informed of the risks associated with their trades.  Finally, we need to make sure that we develop new markets and grow our businesses.\nIn summary, if you follow these simple rules, you can continue to be successful in the CAISO marketplace.\nRegards,\nDave\n\n\nFrom:\tSami Arapoglu/HOU/ECT@ECT on 12/14/2000 01:37 PM\n\t\nTo:\tDavid W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:\t \nSubject:\tEnron's PX position for November\n\nDave:\nCan you give me an update of our PX position for November?\nThanks,\nSami Arapoglu\nENRON CORPORATION\n\n\nFrom:\tDavid W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT on 12/13/2000 03:53 PM\nTo:\tSami Arapoglu/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:\t \nSubject:\tEnron's PX position for December\n\nOur current position on the PX is about $4.5 million dollars.

The legislative leaders have been negotiating a number of key issues with Governor Gray Davis including the rate freeze, generation siting and development, and the establishment of an independent regulatory authority. A deal was struck on these issues on Wednesday afternoon and announced by both Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D) and Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D). The new agreement will be presented to the full Assembly this evening for approval. \n\nAt issue is the establishment of a new Public Utilities Commission which would have power over all decisions concerning rates, services, and contracts. Additionally, the agreement includes provisions that allow the CPUC to approve or deny any future purchase agreements with private developers that are entered into after December 31st.\n\nIf the legislation is approved, it will then go to the Governor for his signature. At this time, it is expected that he will sign the bill without amendments. However, there may be legal challenges from industry groups regarding the constitutionality of the law. \n\nCalifornia Rate Freeze/Rate Reduction\nThere was also news yesterday that the Governor had reached a tentative agreement with legislators on the rate freeze. Under the terms of the proposed agreement, the CPUC would establish an average price cap for residential customers, and the utilities would then buy additional supplies on the open market to bring prices down to the level established by the CPUC. \n\nWhile the details of the rate freeze remain unclear, one thing is clear -- it would be implemented on January 1st. There is currently no discussion about extending the current rate freeze beyond January 1st. \n\nIn addition to the rate freeze, Governor Davis also agreed to eliminate a $5 per megawatt-hour surcharge imposed on electricity generated within California. This move would allow the state to take advantage of lower wholesale prices outside of the state and save consumers money as a result. The savings, however, are not expected to be significant. \n\nNegotiations continue between the Administration and the Legislature on other issues such as energy conservation, greenhouse gas emissions, and the role of the State Department of Water Resources in determining water levels in the Central Valley Project and State Water Project reservoirs. \n\nLegislative Update\nFERC and Enron\nOn October 15th, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued an order directing California regulators to modify their demand response programs. Specifically, the FERC found that \"demand bidding\" did not comply with federal regulations because it encouraged load shifting instead of efficient use of resources. As a result, FERC ordered California to change its program so that it no longer provides financial incentives to utilities to shift demand. \n\nEnron is pleased with the FERC decision. In a statement, Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said that the company supports the decision and believes that it will ultimately benefit Californians. \n\nIn addition, FERC recently announced that it would investigate whether California's decision to shut down two natural gas plants constitutes a violation of the Natural Gas Act. Enron has argued that the shutdown of",

The parties filed motions today in the case (which is pending in the Jefferson County Circuit Court). I believe there are two issues to be decided in the case. First, the court must decide whether the Kentucky Public Service Commission properly authorized an increase in the rate base of the project before it was constructed. Second, if the rate increase was proper, then the court will have to determine what the rate should be after construction of the project.\n\nThe following information comes from the Kentucky Attorney General's office. It appears that LG&E has filed a motion for partial summary judgment asserting that the Kentucky PSC improperly authorized the rate increase for the project before it was constructed. According to the AG's office, the PSC did not make specific findings concerning the reasonableness of the rate increase before it approved it. In addition, the AG claims that the PSC did not follow the procedures required under state law when it reviewed the request to approve the rate increase. Finally, the AG claims that the PSC failed to consider certain testimony in reaching its decision.\n\nIf the PSC improperly authorized the rate increase, then it would appear that the project cannot proceed because the ratepayers do not want to pay the higher rate. If the PSC's action was proper, then the AG will probably file a motion for summary judgment on the second issue -- i.e., what is the appropriate post-construction rate for the project?\n\nRegardless of how these motions turn out, we can expect that a trial on damages will occur sometime later this year. As I mentioned to Nancy, we may need to retain a local counsel to represent us in the litigation.\n\nThanks again for the opportunity to discuss this matter with you.

The following is some information about the project and my interest.  We can discuss more details once you express your interest.\n\nThe project involves taking a 20 year old, 15MW gas turbine out of service and reconditioning it into a 20 MW generator with a new gas path and exhaust system.  This will allow the unit to run on natural gas or propane.  The unit will also be fitted with a modern automation control system.  The project should take approximately 6 months to complete.\n\nOnce completed, the unit will be placed back into service with a long term lease agreement.  There is no requirement that the unit be located in Houston, but it must be near a major city.  Since there are only 4 units like this in existence, I believe that there could be a lot of interest in them as well as a good market value.\n\nIf we proceed with this project, then I would expect our work to start by mid January.\n\nTherefore, if you are interested, please give me a call at 281-332-3100 or email me directly.

In short, the\nlist goes like this:\n\n1)  It bought power in good faith and paid too much for it.  \n\n2)  The state's wholesale market wasn't working right.  We should have let\nit work itself out.  In fact, we shouldn't have been buying power at all if\nthe state's market had been functioning properly.  \n\n3)  When things got bad, the Legislature told us not to sell our assets\nand use the money to pay our customers.  So we didn't, and we spent $2 billion\non gas and other stuff instead.  As such, we shouldn't be penalized by having\nto pay back our customers twice -- once when we buy their power, and again\nwhen we pay the state to keep our plants running so they can produce more\npower.\n\n4)  The state set up an unworkable structure for selling electricity.  Our\ncustomers wouldn't want to buy from us if the state would force them to buy\nfrom someone else.  \n\n5)  The governor, and everyone else, kept saying that everything was fine.\nThe price of natural gas was low.  And there were lots of generating plants\nbeing built all over the place.  So we just went along with everybody else\nand thought that everything was going to be okay.\n\n6)  The prices for power weren't based on supply and demand, anyway.  They\nwere based on the cost of building new power plants.  And since we thought\neveryone was going to build a lot of plants, it made sense to go ahead and\nbuild some ourselves.\n\n7)  The state said that it was okay for us to buy from third parties.\nThat's what we did.  But then, the state changed its mind and said that\neveryone could only buy from the ISO or the Oasis auctions.  Since the ISO\nand Oasis auctions were taking too long to get started, we couldn't do\nbusiness under those rules.  That's why we bought from third parties.  We\ndidn't buy because we knew something was wrong.\n\n8)  The state didn't tell us that it would take four years to fix the\nwholesale market.  Had it done so, we probably wouldn't have bought as much\nelectricity as we did.  Or maybe we would have.  Who knows?  But it sure\nseems like a pretty big deal.\n\n9)  The state also didn't tell us that it would take six weeks to get\ngeneration back on line after the state took down the power plants.  Had\nit done so, we probably wouldn't have bought as much electricity as we did.\nOr maybe we would have.  Who knows?  But it sure seems like a pretty big\ndeal.\n\n10)  The state's \"diversity requirement,\" which requires that utilities buy\na certain percentage of their power from small and midsize generators,\ncontributed to the crisis.  As such, it shouldn't be applied retroactively.\nIf the state wants to continue enforcing the diversity requirement, it\nshould require PG&E and Edison to buy",

As you can see, there are a number of areas where responsibility is shared between different departments within EES, EBS and Corporate.  These areas have been identified and will be addressed as follows:\n\nContractors & Temp Staff:  All contract staff currently working within GBS will remain in place until replacement resources can be secured from the wider company.  This process has already started and should be completed within the next month or so.\nGlobal Risk Management:  We will require assistance from EES Legal to review all contracts that are in force or currently being negotiated.  The objective here is to ensure that any risk management agreements (i.e. insurance) required to support the business are fully covered.  EES Legal will also assist us in the preparation of new legal documentation such as master services agreements.  In addition, EES Legal will support the GBS Project Team in its role as project manager for this initiative.  It is essential that we develop a single point of accountability for all global risk management activities across the company.  This should be achieved through the appointment of one individual who will report directly to the Chief Operating Officer.  A final decision on this appointment has not yet been made but will be announced shortly. \nHuman Resources:  We will also require the assistance of HR in the recruitment of key senior positions in London.  HR will be responsible for ensuring that all candidates selected for these roles meet the requirements of the company and that they are willing to relocate to Houston if necessary.  This will be particularly important given the need for people to be able to travel frequently between offices.\nIT:  IT will be responsible for the provision of the infrastructure required for this business including voice and data communications, e-mail facilities etc.  IT will also be responsible for providing hardware and software to enable the business to operate effectively.  IT will continue to work closely with Legal and Tax to ensure that all contractual obligations and tax issues are properly managed.\nCorporate Security:  Security will support this function in the same way as it does for other parts of the company.\nEnvironmental Health & Safety:  Environmental health and safety will be responsible for managing risks associated with this business.  EHS will also be responsible for identifying and implementing procedures to ensure that the operations of this business comply with all local, state and federal regulations.  EHS will be supported by EES Legal in the drafting of new policies and procedures to govern the business.\nFinance:  Finance will be responsible for the provision of all financial reports required for this business.  Finance will also be responsible for ensuring that all financial transactions are processed correctly.  Finance will work closely with Tax to ensure that all commercial arrangements entered into by this business are fully documented and that all tax implications are properly considered.\nTax:  Tax will be responsible for ensuring that all commercial arrangements entered into by this business comply with all relevant tax legislation.  Tax will work closely with",

In short, I want to confirm the following:\n\n1.  The original LNG contracts were entered into on behalf of ECTRL by Enron Canada.  These contracts were transferred to ENA as soon as possible after the split.\n\n2.  The original contracts do not include any amendments or other documents that may be required under the terms of the LNG contracts themselves.  I have copies of all of these documents.\n\n3.  The only exceptions to the above are the \"letter agreements\" between ECTRL and each of the respective shippers.  Each letter agreement confirms certain key information regarding the specific shipment, such as the destination port, etc., and also contains the contact information for the relevant shipper.  I believe we can access these letters from our system, but I will confirm with ECTRL and Enron Canada to ensure there is no discrepancy here.\n\n4.  All of the letters signed by the various shippers (except for Kuwait) are still valid.  If any shipper was unable to sign an agreement, then we are either aware of it (in the case of Qatar and Bahrain), or we can obtain a copy of their agreement from ECTRL or Enron Canada (in the case of the others).  Again, I will check with ECTRL and Enron Canada to verify the status of the letters signed by the various shippers.\n\n5.  Regarding the \"Master Agreement\" referenced in the ECTRL letter dated 11/21/01, we do have a master agreement with each of the individual shipping companies (except for Kuwait), however we do not have any master",

He also mentioned that we shouldn't use the \nparent company name when using CATS, since it will look like a new counter \nparty has been created and added to the system.

    "I'm interested in your perspective; feel free to contact me at 713-853-6402.\n\nI've been trying to figure out how the FERC has jurisdiction over pipelines for years now, but have never really found a good answer.  The most common reason I hear is that the FERC regulates interstate commerce and therefore can regulate all pipeline transportation of oil, gas or electricity regardless of their ownership status.  However, there are several problems with this argument:\n\n1)\tThe FERC does not have any explicit statutory authority to regulate intrastate pipelines - its only authority comes from Section 201(a) of the Natural Gas Act which allows it to regulate \"the sale of natural gas in interstate commerce.\"  This makes no sense when you consider that interstate pipelines are subject to both state and federal regulation (since they cross state lines).  It seems like the FERC should be able to regulate them under Section 201(b), which states \"If the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission finds that a State or municipality, in violation of the antitrust laws of the United States, has monopolized, attempted to monopolize, or unfairly used or abused power or authority in contravention of the antitrust laws of the United States, then the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may by order require such State or municipality to comply with the provisions of [Section 201]...and shall impose such other remedial actions as the circumstances may warrant.\"  This would allow the FERC to regulate intrastate pipelines if they were engaged in anticompetitive behavior that affected interstate commerce.  \n\n2)\tAs discussed above, the FERC argues that it has authority over intrastate pipelines because they are subject to state regulation.  However, if the FERC had jurisdiction over intrastate pipelines, why would Congress have passed the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act?  This act, which was signed into law on October 29, 2002, gives the Department of Transportation (DOT) authority over all aspects of pipeline safety including the enforcement of minimum safety standards.  This includes the regulation of intrastate pipelines.  So if the DOT has jurisdiction over intrastate pipelines, why doesn't the FERC have jurisdiction?  Or vice versa?  Either way, I think it shows that neither agency has jurisdiction over intrastate pipelines.\n\nAnyway, if you have any ideas about this issue, please let me know.

You may want to have language to indicate that we are not liable for anything that happens due to third party use.

This individual will be responsible for identifying commercial opportunities both inside and outside of ENA that we believe are strategic to our success.  They will also be charged with coordinating and managing cross functional efforts required to execute these initiatives.  The ideal candidate should be able to identify and develop these opportunities as well as manage teams and resources needed to achieve the objectives.  As a result, they need to have strong leadership skills and extensive industry experience.\n\nIdeally, this role will report directly into myself, however, given the importance of this position and the potential impact on earnings, it may make sense to have this person report to you (Louise) and work closely with you on projects such as Northern Border Partnership.  In either case, we want someone who is focused on finding new commercial opportunities, but not necessarily someone from the traditional business development world.  They should also have some operational background as well as excellent financial acumen.  Given the breadth of this opportunity, I am looking for a senior level candidate.\n\nIf you agree with my assessment and if you think there is an appropriate person within your organization, I would like to get together this week to discuss.  I would also like to set up a time to meet with him/her prior to making an offer.  If you do not currently have anyone in mind, please let me know so that I can begin searching externally.\n\nThanks,\nJeff Skilling\n\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDenne, Karen  \nSent:\tThursday, January 10, 2002 5:56 PM\nTo:\tNemec, Gerald\nCc:\tShankman, Jeffrey A.\nSubject:\tRe: Vice President of Commercial Development\nImportance:\tHigh\n\nGerald,\n\nIn general, I agree with Jeff's thinking here.

I've got a few questions\nthat are outlined below.  I will be back from vacation next week and would\nlike to discuss these issues with you then.  In the meantime, if you can send\nme your answers (or call me at my home number), that would be helpful.\n\n1)  The current market value of the company is $1.2 billion.  The company has\n$10 million of cash on its balance sheet.  Your valuation model assumes the\ncompany will spend about $1 million per year on working capital.  That means\nthe company would have to grow at 11 percent per annum just to maintain\ncurrent levels of debt and equity.  How do you see this happening?\n\n2)  You indicate that Enron currently trades at about 14 times EBITDA.  How\ndo you project earnings growth into the future?  What would be a reasonable\nmultiple for those projections?\n\n3)  You indicate that the company should not raise capital in the near term\ngiven current high leverage.  Do you expect leverage to stay as high as it\nis now or to decrease significantly?\n\n4)  If you were able to increase shareholder returns by growing earnings, what\nwould be a realistic multiple to use for the stock price?\n\n5)  What percentage of revenues does Enron currently devote to research and\ndevelopment?  Are there plans to increase spending in this area?\n\nThank you very much for your time.  It was good talking to you again today.\nI look forward to speaking with you next week.\n\nJeff McMahon\nManaging Director\nInterCapital Advisors LLC\n(646) 660-4465\njeff.mcmahon@intercapitaladvisors.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis e-mail message may contain legally privileged and/or confidential \ninformation.

The loans will be repaid in full within 10 days of departure, the\ncompanies said.\nIn return, both airlines have agreed to offer discounts to members of American\nExpress' Platinum and Centurion card holders.\nThe airlines were also granted waivers of certain fees related to the\nloans, such as those associated with baggage and reservations.\n\"We are pleased that our relationship with American Express has evolved into\nthis innovative, win-win arrangement,\" said Northwest Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Richard Anderson.\nHe said the loans are important because of the short timeframe involved,\nwith Christmas only two weeks away.\n\"This is not just about the holiday season; it's about helping us keep our\nfleets flying and our employees working throughout this difficult period.\"\nDelta said the loan was part of a broader agreement that includes an\nagreement under which American Express' affiliates will become the exclusive\nnetwork services provider for Delta and its partner SkyTeam alliance member\nAir France S.A.\nDelta and Northwest are merging their respective networks under the SkyTeam\nbrand name and the companies plan to operate under one set of codeshare\nrelationships.\nUnder the agreement, American Express will provide customer service and\ninformation technology systems to all SkyTeam carriers and their partners.\nAs part of the deal, American Express will receive an equity stake in the\nnewly merged company, but financial terms were not disclosed.\nNorthwest spokeswoman Kristi Coulter said Tuesday the loans should help ease\nsome of the burden on the airlines caused by the terrorist attacks Sept. 11.\nBut she added that the airline industry would still benefit from the\ncontinuing boost in air traffic resulting from the holiday season.\n\"We've been pretty good at keeping up with the demand for tickets,\" Coulter\nsaid. \"I think we'll continue to see some growth over the next few months.\"\nAmerican Express shares rose 2 cents to $53.36 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nDelta shares fell 72 cents to $17.67.\nShares of Northwest closed unchanged at $5.56.\nDelta and Northwest shares have fallen sharply since the Sept. 11 attacks and\nhave yet to recover from the impact of the post-attack slowdown in business\ntravel.\nDelta said last week that it would reduce its total workforce by 10% when the\nmerger is completed.\nNorthwest, meanwhile, announced late Monday that it would cut its staff by 2,000\njobs by year end, or 10%, due to a continued decline in business travel",

It's\nbeen too long since our last get together.  I miss all of you very much.  \nIt\nseems like a lifetime ago when we were all hanging out together at the\nFour Seasons.  But, hey...it's been over four years now....that's a lot of\ntime!\n\nI want to take this opportunity to wish you all a wonderful holiday season.\nI\nknow there will be some difficult times ahead, but I pray that we can look\nback on 2001 as the year of transition to brighter days.\n\nAs far as my family goes, we had a great Thanksgiving Day.  We took\nadvantage of the early bird special at Sam's Club and loaded up on lots of\ngood food.  We also went shopping at a few stores and got a head start on\nChristmas.\n\nAll in all, things are going well for me.  My son Jared has done quite well\nthis semester and he just received his first scholarship award from The\nUniversity of Texas at San Antonio.  He'll graduate next May.  In addition,\nI am blessed to be working for an employer who understands and respects the\nfamily unit.  I've always been grateful for that.\n\nOn the home front, I'm still married to my best friend, Donna, and we're\ntaking care of her mother, Virginia.  Virginia was diagnosed with cancer\nlast January and she's been undergoing chemotherapy treatments ever since.\nShe's doing fairly well right now, but her prognosis isn't very promising.\nShe's not expected to live more than another three months.  Needless to say,\nwe're making sure she gets the best possible care.\n\nSo, basically, life is pretty normal here.  Of course, there's nothing really\nnormal about life these days.  All around us we see people suffering from\nthe effects of this tragedy.  Many of them will never be the same again.  We\nare truly living in unprecedented times.\n\nOnce again, thank you so much for being such dear friends to me and mine.\nI love you all very much.\n\nTake care,\n\nRodger\n\n**********************************************\nCheck out my new World Wide Web site!\nhttp://rodgermstokes.tripod.com\n**********************************************\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email alerts & Yahoo!

I just tried to log on again and it worked fine.  I think that your modem must be interfering with something in the software or vice versa.  It seems like your internet connection is okay because I am also using my modem through the router.  Are you sure that you are not accidentally holding down the \"hold\" button for too long when you are trying to reconnect?  If so, then your best bet is to try unplugging your modem from the power source and plugging it back in.  That usually does the trick.  Let me know how it goes.\n\nThanks,\n\nWilliam R.
