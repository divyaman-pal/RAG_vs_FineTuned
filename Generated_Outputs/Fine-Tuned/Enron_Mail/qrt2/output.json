    "From: ian.brungs@enron.com, To: pierre.aury@enron.com\nDate: 21/09/00 at 15:48\nSubject: RE: SAP\n\n\nPierre,\n\nI agree with you that we should go for a \"SAP Business Partner\" solution rather than trying to do the whole thing in house (as it would be very difficult for us to get an understanding of what was going on).\n\nAs I said before, my suggestion is to go for a \"SAP Business Partner\" who will also act as a consultant for our project. That way, we can get more involved and understand what is going on while still having access to someone who has gone through this process before and knows what is needed.\n\nRegarding your question about the implementation team: I think that it is too early to decide right now. We need to see how things are going first. The only problem is that there may be a lot of people working on this project at any given time which could lead to confusion if we don't have a clear plan yet. But I am sure that we will come up with something once we start looking into it.\n\nIf you want to talk further about this subject feel free to give me a call or drop me an email.\n\nCheers,\n\nPierre.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Pierre Aury [mailto:pierre.aury@enron.com]\nSent: Friday, September 22, 2000 3:07 PM\nTo: Ian Brungs\nSubject: SAP\n\n\nHey Pete,\n\nI just wanted to let you know that we are making progress on the SAP\nimplementation but that there is still some work left to be done. In\nparticular, the implementation team is currently working on the design of\nthe ERP system and the infrastructure requirements.\n\nIn terms of SAP implementation, I think that we should try to keep things\nsimple and not over complicate them. If possible, I think that we should\ntry to implement the core functionalities ourselves (i.e. we don't need to\nhave anyone else implement it for us) since doing so will make us more\ninvolved in the process and allow us to learn more about SAP. As far as\nthis goes, we might want to look at getting a \"SAP Business Partner\" to help\nus out since they are usually experts in the field and will likely have\ndone similar implementations before. However, the main concern here is\nthat the Business Partners are not always reliable since they often lack\nexperience in implementing large scale projects and sometimes disappear\nafter taking the money.\n\nAnother point that I wanted to discuss with you is that we should have a\nclear idea of what we expect from our project manager. As mentioned earlier,\nI think that we should try to hire someone experienced in implementing\nERP systems and preferably someone who has worked with SAP in the past. On\ntop of that, it would be nice if he had previous experience dealing with\nlarge companies and was familiar with our business model. However, these\nrequirements could be quite expensive and it may take us a while to find\nsomeone qualified enough. Therefore, one alternative would be to use someone\nwho has already been working on the project to manage the project until we\ncan find the right person.\n\nFinally, I would like to mention that we haven't talked much lately since\nyou have been busy with your own project. How is everything going? Are you\nsure that you can handle two projects by yourself? You seem to be really\nbusy these days and I hope that nothing bad happens! Anyway, if you have\nany questions or comments regarding anything please feel free to contact\nme.\n\nCheers,\n\nPierre.\n\n_______________________________________________\nIan Brungs - Software Developer - Enron Europe Ltd.\nTel : +44(0)20-7631-3165\nFax : +44(0)20-7631-3303\nMobile : +44(0)791-509-4445\nEmail : ian.brungs@enron.com <mailto:ian.brungs@enron.com>\n__________________________________________________\n\nThis e-mail (and any attachments) contains confidential information intended\nfor a specific individual and purpose, and is protected by law.

This position has caused the stock price to fall.  This\nhas caused many employees to lose money.  As an employee of Enron, I think\nthis is very unfortunate.  I am sure that the company has discussed\npossible legal actions against UBS.  It appears that some of these actions\nare starting to occur (the SEC has filed an action).  If UBS were to lose\nany of its short positions, it could cause the firm to go under.  This could\ncreate a situation where people who have lost money in their retirement\naccounts would end up losing even more money.  In addition, it could lead to\nthe loss of jobs, which would create additional hardship for our families.\n\n(b)  With regard to the job situation, you may be aware that the company is\nundergoing significant restructuring.  This has resulted in a great deal of\nchange.  People are leaving the company.  There are new responsibilities.\nPeople are getting moved around within the organization.  These changes\ncan create stress.\n\nI hope that you understand why I did not respond to your email.  I certainly\nappreciated your note and I wish you the best.\n\nHarald\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! GeoCities - affordable website hosting",

(NYSE: GIS)\nMost Recent Price: $59.95\nCurrent P/E Ratio: 19.1x\nDividend Yield: 3.0%\nPrice Target Upside Potential: 20%\nLong-Term EPS Growth Rate: 6.5%\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nTo learn more about our services and how to subscribe please visit\nhttp://www.stockfirst.com or call us at 888-884-5865.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRESEARCH REPORT ON GENERAL MILLS INC. (NYSE: GIS)\n\nGeneral Mills Inc., incorporated in Delaware in March of 1928, is a consumer packaged foods company with sales in over 100 countries worldwide. The Company manufactures and markets branded and unbranded food products for retail consumers and the foodservice industry. General Mills' portfolio includes over 100 brands, including Cheerios, Nature Valley, H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream, Old El Paso and many others. In fiscal year ended May 31, 2000, the Company sold approximately US$10 billion worth of goods in the United States and Canada. Its international operations are conducted through four business units: North America; Europe, Asia and Africa; Latin America and Australia; and Asia. As of July 1, 2000, General Mills operates 19 plants in six countries, including eight in the United States and one each in Mexico, Canada, Thailand and Brazil. The Company also has sales offices in 16 countries. The Company operates three divisions: Meals, Baking Products & Fruit; Convenience Foods; and Cereal Partners Worldwide. For the twelve months ended May 31, 2000, General Mills posted revenues of US$9.2 billion, operating income of US$943 million, net income of US$693 million and earnings per share of US$2.06.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nINVESTMENT SUMMARY\n\nInvestors looking for an oversold stock with strong fundamentals should consider General Mills Inc. (NYSE: GIS). The company is expected to benefit from its diversified product line and strong balance sheet as it enters the new millennium.\n\nGeneral Mills Inc. designs and produces a broad range of consumer packaged food products such as ready-to-eat cereal, flour, baking mixes, frozen desserts, snacks, meats, poultry, and other food products. It sells its products primarily under various brand names. The company's products are distributed throughout the United States and internationally in over 100 countries.\n\nThe company's strength lies in its well-diversified product lines, good financial condition, and a strong management team. With the economy facing headwinds, investors can expect the company to maintain its strong track record.\n\nWe believe General Mills will continue to be a good long-term growth investment, given its robust financial condition and its strong position in the highly fragmented market. We project that the company could grow by 20% this year and 6.5% annually over the next five years.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCompany Profile\n\nGeneral Mills Inc.

    "From: enron_update@concureworkplace.com, To: don.baughman@enron.com\nDate: Thursday, July 26, 2001 11:37 PM\nSubject: Enron Update #195 - July 27, 2001\n\n\n*************************************************************\nEnron Update is published every Wednesday and Sunday by\nPublic Affairs for Enron's government affairs group.\nIf you do not wish to receive this update in the future,\nplease reply to this e-mail with \"unsubscribe\" as the subject.\n*************************************************************\n\n\nGovernor Davis has signed legislation that will allow Enron to use\ncertain of its wholesale energy assets to serve retail customers.\nThe bill will enable the state to make a decision about whether or\nnot to allow utilities to sell into the retail market without\nregulation. The Governor also signed SBX 1, which authorizes the\nstate to issue up to $1 billion in bonds for energy projects. The\nlegislature returns from recess on August 14. It is expected to\nconsider measures that would provide rate relief for small businesses\nand residential consumers and establish new rules governing how the\nstate regulates retail sales.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has voted unanimously\nto begin proceedings that could lead to the sale of SDG&E to a private\nbuyer. A CPUC official said last week that the commission was prepared\nto take action if it does not see progress in negotiations between\nSempra Energy and the state over the terms of the proposed settlement.\nAt the same time, the CPUC voted 5-0 to reject a proposal by PG&E to\nrestrict access to its system by independent power producers.\nProponents argued that the move would stifle competition and drive up\nrates.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers have passed legislation that would require\nelectricity generators to continue service to all customers regardless\nof their creditworthiness. The legislation is designed to prevent\nutilities from cutting off service to small businesses and residential\ncustomers who are behind on their bills. However, the bill does not\nrequire the state to pay the utilities for the lost revenues. In\naddition, the bill does not address the fundamental problem of high\nenergy prices. The bill now goes to the desk of Governor Davis, who\nhas 10 days to sign or veto it. If he signs it, it becomes law unless\nhe vetoes it within five days. If he fails to act after five days, it\nbecomes law without his signature.\n\nIn other news, the California Legislative Analyst released an analysis\nof AB 8x, the so-called \"market-based rate\" measure. The analyst said\nthat the legislation may be too complex to implement and that there were\nmany potential legal obstacles. The analyst suggested that the\nlegislation may create a situation wherein utilities are unable to\ncharge enough to cover their costs, which could result in bankruptcy.\nThe analyst said that the best solution would be to eliminate state\nintervention and let the market work out a solution. The report can be\nfound at http://www.businesswire.com/news/e.htm?id=566470/200107260052691A.\n\nThe California Senate passed legislation that would expand the role of\nthe Public Utilities Commission in regulating natural gas markets. The\nlegislation would give the Commission authority to investigate price\nspikes and determine whether they are caused by manipulative practices.\nIt would also grant the Commission subpoena powers to collect evidence\nfrom companies under investigation. The legislation will next go to the\nAssembly.\n\nMeanwhile, the California Assembly passed legislation that would force\nEnron, Dynegy, Reliant, El Paso, Williams, PG&E and Southern California\nEdison to divest themselves of 25 percent of their shares in\ngeneration facilities. The legislation would apply to any company\nholding more than 10% ownership interest in a generation facility in\nCalifornia. It would also apply to any company holding 10% or more\nownership interests in more than one generation facility in the state.\nThe legislation will next go to the Senate.\n\nLast week, California's largest electric utility announced plans to\nfile for bankruptcy protection.

They are still doing that.  The reason they called me today is because they were trying to get an extension of the current contracts.  They were hoping to extend them until December so they could take advantage of the \"peak\" prices.  Basically the peak prices have gone up quite a bit since May when these contracts were signed.  If we are going to continue to do business with them then we should be prepared to extend the contracts beyond September 20th.  However, they may want us to extend them even further than just December.\n\nLet me know if you need more information.\nWilliam F.

    "From: lance.cunningham@enron.com, To: robert.kraszewski@enron.com\nDate: Tuesday, May 29, 2001 12:35 PM\nSubject: Lance Cunningham\n\n\n\nRobert,\n\nI have completed my initial review of the document and have a few comments.  \nFirst, I agree with your comments regarding the definition of \"material\" \nand would make the following changes:\n\n1)  In paragraph (b), replace \"or materially\" with \"in any manner\".\n2)  In paragraph (d), replace \"or materially\" with \"in any manner\".\n\nSecond, I believe that we should consider deleting the provision which \nstates that an employee will be deemed to have received notice of termination \nif the employee fails to provide the Company with a current address within ten \ndays after the date on which the Company provides written notice to such \nemployee.  This provision is unnecessary in light of the fact that the \nCompany's obligation to pay severance benefits ends once the employee has \nreceived payment for all accrued but unpaid compensation due at the time of \ntermination.  In addition, this provision could lead to unnecessary \nlitigation if it were ever contested by either party.\n\nThird, I believe that you should also consider deleting the provision which \nstates that the Company shall not be required to continue to provide health \ninsurance coverage for any employee who terminates employment with the \nCompany before the end of the COBRA continuation period.  The Company may \nwant to retain the right to require employees to pay for their COBRA \ncoverage in order to protect its interests.  If this issue was to arise, then \nthe Company should draft a separate document addressing its rights under the \nCOBRA provisions of ERISA.\n\nFinally, I am concerned about the potential liability exposure created by \nthe provision which states that the employee will be liable for any taxes \nwhich are imposed as a result of the receipt of severance benefits or the \namounts paid pursuant to the settlement agreement.  Although this provision \nis intended to cover only taxes which are specifically imposed by reason of \nthe employee's receipt of severance benefits or settlement proceeds, this \nprovision does not specify how these taxes are calculated or what amounts \nwill constitute the basis for calculation of these taxes.  As a result, there \ncould be a significant risk that these taxes would apply to other income or \nassets held by the employee at the time he or she receives the severance \nbenefits or settlement proceeds.  Consequently, I do not think that this \nprovision adequately addresses the employee's potential liability for taxes \non his or her other income and assets.  Accordingly, I suggest that this \nprovision be deleted and replaced with language which specifies the exact \ncalculations used to determine the amount of taxes which the employee will be \nrequired to pay.\n\nRegarding the provision which allows the Company to offset certain types of \ndamages against any payment made to the employee, I am concerned that this \nprovision creates a disincentive for the Company to settle disputes since the \nsettlement payment will be reduced by any damages that might later be found \nagainst the Company.  It seems that the intent of this provision is to \nprotect the Company from having to pay more than once for damages caused by \nan employee's negligence or misconduct, but I don't think that the Company \nshould be able to take into account future claims against the employee when \ndetermining whether to offer a settlement.  Instead, I think that the \nCompany should be required to pay all outstanding amounts owed to the \nemployee without regard to any amount which may be claimed in the future by \nany third parties.  This approach would eliminate any concerns about \ndiscouraging settlement and allow the employee to receive a full settlement \npayment regardless of the existence of any potential claims against him or \nher.  I would like to discuss this matter further so please call me when you \nhave a moment.\n\nRegards,\nLance\n---------------------- Forwarded by Lance Cunningham/Corp/Enron on 05/29/2001 \n12:29 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nRobert Kraszewski\n05/2",

The 1st chart is a comparison of \nthe current pipeline rates to what they were in January (before the rate cut).  \nThe 2nd chart compares the current rates to where they would be if we had not \nreceived any rate relief.  I have calculated these values based on the rates \nthat are listed in the tables that were given to us at our meeting last week.  \nTherefore, the rates that are listed here are approximate and may not be \nexact.  Also, the volumes used in this analysis are nominal flow volumes, so \nthey should not be taken as an exact number.  Finally, I do not have a \nconservation factor for the 941-G.

I am trying to convince some of my friends to go see the movie \"Jesus\".  It is a very moving movie about Christ's life and death on the cross.  One of my friends told me that she saw this movie last year, but was never able to get anyone else to go see it with her.  She really wants to see it again, so I suggested that maybe if you went with her, then maybe she would be more inclined to take others with her.

The conference will also feature sessions on risk management techniques and an in-depth look at key issues facing the sector today.\n\nThe event will feature speakers representing some of the largest companies operating in the energy markets and will provide delegates with an excellent networking platform in which they can make valuable contacts within the industry.\n\nWe hope you will consider joining us in New York this November. If you would like to find out more about the conference please click here.\n\nhttp://www.riskonline.com/conference/energy/newyorkcity.asp?cid=3D29087&eid=3D55360\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nVince Kaminski\nRiskOnline.com\n\nP.S.:  Please forward this message to anyone who may benefit from attending our events.=20\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nConference Brochure\n\n\nPower & Gas Financial Risk Management in a Changing Environment\nNovember 14th and 15th, 2001\nWaldorf Astoria Hotel - New York\n\n\nClick Here For More Information On This Event\nhttp://www.riskonline.com/conference/energy/newyorkcity.asp?cid=3D29087&eid=3D55360\n\n\nPower & Gas Physical Risk Management in a Changing Environment\nNovember 14th and 15th, 2001\nWaldorf Astoria Hotel - New York\n\n\nClick Here For More Information On This Event\nhttp://www.riskonline.com/conference/energy/newyorkcity.asp?cid=3D29087&eid=3D55360\n\n\n\nSpeakers at last year's event included:\n\n- Michael Benson, President, PJM Interconnection\n- Peter Hunt, Executive Director, Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n- Jeffrey Keeler, Managing Partner, Merrill Lynch Global Power & Natural Gas Origination\n- John Shay, Vice President, Dynegy Direct Marketing\n- Mike Sullivan, Senior Vice President, Entergy Corporation\n- James Steffes, General Counsel, Calpine Corporation\n\nTo register for either or both conferences, please visit http://www.riskonline.com/conference/energy/newyorkcity.asp?cid=3D29087&eid=3D55360\n\nIf you have any questions regarding registration, please contact Chris Crawford at ccrawfo@risk.co.uk or call +44 (0)20 7772 7060.\n\nWe hope to see you in New York!\n\nBest Regards\n\nVince Kaminski\nManaging Editor\nRiskOnline\nhttp://www.riskonline.com/\n\n\nThis email was sent to Vince Kaminski\n\nIf you would prefer not to receive further emails from RiskOnline please send an email to unsubscribe@risk.co.uk stating your name and postal address and providing details of how you wish to opt out of receiving communications from us.

In fact,\nwe've had a few conversations about this already and it seems like an\ninteresting area to explore.\n\nI think you probably understand that we don't want to give away any\ninformation about our plans regarding our potential participation in\nTransAlta's proposed venture in North America.  However, I suspect\nthat we can still discuss how best to pursue opportunities in the\nCanadian market without getting into specifics at this stage.  We are\nalso happy to answer any questions that you might have about what\nTransAlta is doing in Canada.\n\nWith respect to timing, I'm available on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday\nmorning.  Let me know which works better for you.\n\nThanks again for making the effort to contact us.  It was good to catch up\nwith you in Calgary.  Hopefully we'll see you soon.\n\nBest regards,\nBarton\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom:   \"Cindy Stelzer\" <cstelzer@avistaenergy.com>@ENRON\n[mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Cindy+20Stelzer+22+20+3CCstelzer+40avistaenergy+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com]\nSent:   Monday, February 18, 2002 1:41 PM\nTo:     'rdavidson@transalta.com'\nSubject:  TransAlta/Enron meeting\n\nRod & Bart:\n\nAs promised, here is some information about the TransAlta/Enron joint\nventure in Western Canada.\n\nThe partnership will create a new company called Alberta Power Exchange\n(APX).

This innovative power plant can be installed in 6 months and will generate profits for the next 20 years.\n\nThis new power plant utilizes existing technology to produce electricity from coal. It does not require any special fuel or catalysts, nor any expensive infrastructure. The key component of our power plant is a patent pending, unique process for making superheated steam (in excess of 900 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe patented process uses standard, off-the-shelf equipment that can be easily transported by truck to remote locations. The equipment operates without external combustion air and produces high quality, low sulfur, low nitrogen oxide emissions. This process eliminates the need for costly water treatment facilities, which are required by most power plants today.\n\nAs with all Circline projects, this project is very cost effective and requires no long term contracts with governments. All contracts are directly between buyers and sellers and the power produced is sold as it is generated.\n\nFor more information please contact me at your convenience.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJonathan R.

Dinehart, Associate Dean at the\nUniversity of Houston Law Center (UHLC), wrote to me requesting that we\nimmediately cease all recruitment activity at UHLC.  He cited the fact that\nour recruiters were making \"derogatory\" remarks about the law students who\nattended our events.  Additionally, he stated that our recruiters had made\n\"inappropriate sexual comments\" directed at female students.  Finally, Mr.\nDinehart complained that our recruiters had \"sat in on classes without the\nconsent or knowledge of the professor.\"\n\nEnron has never made such derogatory remarks toward any law student at UHLC\nor at any other institution where we recruit.  Our recruiters also make no\nsexual advances toward females.  In fact, our recruiters are instructed not to\nmake advances towards anyone.  Furthermore, it is never appropriate for a\nrecruiter to sit in on a class without prior permission of the professor.  We\nare sorry if these actions occurred during our recent visit to UHLC.  If they\ndid occur, we apologize sincerely to the students involved.\n\nWe responded to Mr. Dinehart's initial letter and offered to meet with him to\ndiscuss the matter further.  He never accepted our offer to meet.  As a\nresult, we were unable to discuss the matter further with Mr. Dinehart.  On\nMay 7, however, Mr. Dinehart called me again.  During this conversation, he\nagain expressed his concerns about Enron's behavior.  He stated that some of\nthe incidents which occurred during our visit were so serious that he would\nbe required to recommend to the ABA that the school be placed on probation.\nMr. Dinehart told me that he planned to submit written documentation to the\nABA to support his position.\n\nOn May 9, I spoke with Mary Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Legal Affairs at\nEnron, to review the situation.  Mary agreed that it was necessary to meet\nwith Mr. Dinehart as soon as possible.  I then contacted Mr. Dinehart by\ntelephone to arrange another meeting.  Mr. Dinehart informed me that he was\ntraveling out of town until May 21.  He suggested that we postpone our next\nmeeting until May 29.  I asked Mr. Dinehart whether Enron could provide any\nadditional information to demonstrate how seriously we take our recruiting\nactivities.  He said that he did not feel comfortable asking us to provide any\ninformation before speaking with him personally.  I explained to Mr. Dinehart\nthat, although it is difficult to schedule time off work, we would like to\narrange a meeting between Mr. Dinehart and a representative of Enron in order\nto discuss the situation.  Mr. Dinehart replied that he would call me when he",

I am looking\nat some games that will be playing on Friday, October 28th. I was thinking\nof taking the kids on a road trip from here back to San Antonio. They\ncould stay at my parents house while we were gone. My Mom said they could\ncome spend the night with her after school on Wednesday, October 26th or\nThursday, October 27th and then leave on Saturday morning. What do you think?\nDo you have any other ideas? Are there any games coming up that we should\ncheck into? I don't want to book anything until I hear back from you. Let me\nknow what you think.\n\nThanks, Jennifer\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Benjamin Rogers [mailto:benjamin.rogers@enron.com]\nSent: Monday, October 24, 2005 9:49 AM\nTo: Jennifer Neff\nSubject: RE: Trip to the Padre's game on Thursday night!!!\n\n\nHi Jennifer,\n\nWe had a great time hanging out on Friday and Saturday.  The kids had fun\nwith the boys.  It was too bad that it rained on Sunday, but it was still a\nnice day.  I hope you and the girls had a nice time.  I can't believe how\nfast the girls are growing.",

We\nare interested in talking with you about the possibility of a web page\ndesign contract.  Our company is the legal department of Enron Corp. and our\nprimary function is to protect Enron's interests through various contractual\nagreements.  One such agreement includes the internet where we have numerous\nwebsites which provide the public with access to specific documents such as\nthe Annual Report and SEC filings.  We would like to re-design these sites\nin order to make them more user friendly.  For example, we have recently\nredesigned our internal intranet site and have found that the overall look and\nfeel has improved dramatically.  Also, some of our sites contain outdated\ninformation and need to be updated.  In short, we want to improve the overall\nappearance of our websites but we need to ensure that the functionality of\nthese sites remains intact.  My question for you is whether or not you can\nprovide us with the following services:\n\n\t1.  Website Design Services including Site Analysis, User Interface, Site\n\t\tNavigation, Page Layout, Visual Design, Information Architecture and\n\t\tContent Management.\n\t2.  Site Redesign/Redesign Development\n\t3.  Hosting, Maintenance and Support Services\n\nIf you could respond back with an estimate of what type of services you could\nprovide and any other relevant information, it would be greatly appreciated.\nAlso, would you like to meet to discuss this further?  Finally, how long does\nit take to get started once we decide to proceed with a contract?\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Lisa Mellencamp/HOU/ECT on 01/24/2002\n04:17 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nDebra Perlingiere\n01/24/2002 01:27 PM\n\n\nTo:   \"Lisa Mellencamp\" <lisa.mellencamp@enron.com>\ncc:\nSubject:  RE:\n\n\n\nHi Lisa!

    "From: steven.kean@enron.com, To: kristin.gandy@enron.com\nDate: 10/23/01 8:49 AM\nSubject: Re: CRC Update - Oct. 22, 2001\n\n\nThe CRC has asked for a response by Friday at noon, but we will have until\nOctober 26th to file our comments with the CPUC.  I believe that we should\nnot give them an answer by Friday.  I think it is critical that we respond\nwith a strong statement that the Commission has already made its decision on\nthe PX.  In fact, we need to point out that even if the RTO were implemented\nthat the PX would still be needed.  We may also want to point out that in\norder to implement the RTO, the Commission needs to make decisions about how\nto allocate resources between the generation and transmission systems,\nwhich they do not appear to have done.  If the CPUC does not address this,\nthen it will be difficult for the utilities to implement the RTO without the\nPX.  The other issue is whether the CRC has standing to bring their case to\nthe Commission.  I am fairly certain that they do not.  Their argument seems\nto be that as a group of parties who are affected by the RTO, they have\nstanding to file their brief.  This is true, but so does everyone else.  By\nfiling a case with the Commission, the CRC is asking the Commission to find\nthat there is an immediate problem with the implementation of the RTO.  It\nis unclear to me why they think that there is an urgent problem here.  There\nare other groups filing cases (including the UDC), which should take care of\nany problems with implementing the RTO.  As far as I know, the CRC's only\nargument is that they don't like the way the RTO is being implemented.  They\nhave not identified any particular problem or error that the Commission has\nmade that needs to be fixed right now.  Perhaps they think that there is some\nproblem with getting all of the parties to agree on a plan.  But again, I do\nnot see how that would require the Commission to act immediately.  If there\nis something they are trying to argue, I would ask them what it is.  If they\njust want to argue that they do not like the way the RTO is being implemented,\nI think we can deal with that.\n\n\n\nkristin.gandy@enron.com on 10/23/2001 07:55:05 AM\nTo: skean@enron.com\ncc:  \n\nSubject: CRC Update - Oct. 22, 2001\n\n\nSteve-\n\nPlease let me know what you think about the following.

This was an important sticking point in negotiations with industry stakeholders that led to the elimination of this provision.\n\nOther key modifications include:\n\n* The new order requires all parties who receive bundled services to provide the information necessary to assess the need for improved interconnection standards.\n* It establishes a task force to develop interconnection standards for facilities greater than 100 MW.\n* It eliminates the proposed provision requiring market participants to provide data on their access needs to each regional transmission organization (RTO).\n* It sets a deadline of April 1, 2002 for states to adopt the interconnection standards adopted by the task force.\n* It extends the timeframe for developing and implementing the interconnection procedures for facilities greater than 100 MW to December 31, 2003.\n\nThe FERC order directs the staff to issue a notice of inquiry within 30 days after the effective date of the final rule to consider whether to revise the interstate pipeline siting authority set forth at Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act. The order also requests comments on whether FERC should propose amendments to the existing regulations governing the jurisdiction of the FERC over natural gas pipelines. The order states that these proceedings are intended to ensure that natural gas pipelines are able to respond quickly and efficiently to changing conditions in the marketplace.\n\nFor more information about this filing, contact us at 1-800-523-4911 or visit our website at www.ferc.gov\nFT Energy Services, Inc.\n\nFax: 1-800-523-4911\nToll Free: 1-800-523-4911\nDirect Dial: 703-561-3210\n\nwww.ftenergy.com\n\n(C) Copyright 2001 FT Energy Services, Inc.

Although I\nbelieve the World Series was lost due to poor defense, I think you played\nvery well, especially considering how much pressure there was on you.

I think the best way to explain it is to show you what we have and ask you if you think it's sufficient.\n\nThe easiest way to describe what we need is to describe the current process.  Basically, when a new deal comes into Enron, it has to go through three different steps to get to the point at which it's entered in the database:\n\n1. Deal flow comes out of the traders and into Risk Management.\n2. Risk Management checks the deal, makes changes as necessary, and sends the deal back out to the trader.\n3. The trader then enters the deal into the database.\n\nEach step has its own problems, but the second one is probably the most critical.  The reason is that the deal comes back out of Risk Management because they didn't like something about it (ie. they don't know how to handle a transaction), and they often change the details of the deal.  As a result, the trader doesn't have much confidence in the information he's getting.  It's not uncommon to have a deal come back out of Risk Management that differs slightly from the original, and then the trader has to spend time checking the accuracy of the deal rather than entering it into the system.\n\nWhat we'd like to do is eliminate these three steps completely.  Instead of the deal coming out of Risk Management and back into the trader, we'd like to automate the process such that the deal comes directly into Risk Management, gets checked by risk management, and then gets automatically entered into the database without having to go back to the trader.\n\nIn order to accomplish this, we need to get access to the same information that Risk Management currently uses to check the deals.  Basically, we need to get a snapshot of the deal at every stage of the process, including the initial trade between the buyer and seller.\n\nWhen we started this project, we had to build a system from scratch in order to get access to the information we needed.  Now that we're finished building that system, we need to re-engineer it so that we can use the existing tools and processes that everyone else is already using.  The only thing we can't figure out is whether",

Smith'\nSubject: Hours of Service Regulations\n\n\nGood Morning!\n\nI was just informed by my FMCSA compliance officer that the new hours of service regulations for drivers in interstate commerce have been published and are effective immediately.   The regulations can be found on the FMCSA website at http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hourserv.htm.\n\nPlease note that there is a special exemption under the new rules for those drivers who are operating within a 100 mile radius from their normal work location.\n\nIn addition, there are a number of other exceptions under which an owner operator may operate without regard to the rules.   These include the following:\n\n*   The driver operates within a 150 mile radius of his normal work location.\n*   The driver operates under the \"local delivery exception\".  This means the driver can make local deliveries up to 240 miles per day.\n*   The driver is making an emergency run or if he has been disabled by mechanical failure, weather conditions, or traffic congestion.  In either case, the driver must maintain a record of the event in writing with the carrier.\n*   The driver operates under the \"short haul operations exception\".  This means the driver is making multiple runs of no more than 100 miles each within any 12 hour period, provided he remains within a 100 mile radius from his regular route.  In addition, he may remain on duty for up to 12 hours after coming on duty.\n*   The driver is performing \"sleeper berth\" operations (see below).\n\nIn short, I believe most of our fleet will not be affected by these changes.  However, please read through the above material carefully and let me know if you have any questions regarding how they apply to your operations.\n\nThank you,\n\nRichard C.

    "From: george.wasaff@enron.com, To: all.states@enron.com\nDate: 12/7/00 1:38 AM\nSubject: EPA's Proposed Rulemaking on New Source Review\n\n\nNew source review (NSR) is a key component of the Clean Air Act's Title I \nprogram to protect public health and welfare by regulating emissions of air \npollutants from stationary sources. The NSR program was intended to ensure \nthat new sources were not built or modified without reducing other emission \nsources in an area to levels that do not result in unreasonable adverse \npublic health effects or visibility impairment. In addition, the NSR program \nis designed to reduce future pollution by requiring existing facilities to \nreduce their emissions when they are modified. \n\nEPA has proposed two major rulemakings related to NSR: one that would replace \nthe current requirements for permitting new and modified sources with a \nsystem based on a cap-and-trade approach; the second would establish a \nprocedure that would allow states to opt out of certain NSR requirements for \nnew and modified sources located within their borders.\n\nThe agency also proposes amendments to several existing NSR programs, including \na change in the definition of \"major\" to exclude any new or modified source \nfrom which no significant increase in emissions occurs as a result of the \nmodification. It also proposes to make minor changes to the procedures used \nfor determining what constitutes a major modification to a facility. \n\nThe NSR program is implemented through a complex web of statutes, regulations, \nguidance documents, and court decisions that have led to confusion about the \nrequirements for applying NSR to many sources. \n\nAs part of our efforts to address this problem, we are proposing to \nreorganize the NSR rules into a more logical format that will clarify how these \nrules apply to different types of sources. We are also proposing to revise \nseveral sections of the NSR rules to provide greater clarity and uniformity.  \nIn particular, we are proposing to improve the definitions of terms used in \nthe NSR program and to clarify which sources should be subject to NSR. We are \nalso proposing to simplify the process for demonstrating compliance with the \nNSR requirements. \n\nThese proposals include the following provisions:\n\n* Clarifying the application of NSR to electric generating units, \nrefineries, and other major industrial sources\n\n* Providing flexibility in the implementation of the NSR program for small \nand seasonal sources\n\n* Revising the definition of \"major\" so that it does not require a site-by-site \nanalysis of each emission source at a facility to determine whether a \nfacility is a major stationary source\n\n* Clarifying the role of state and local governments under the NSR program\n\nWe are also proposing to adopt revisions to the NSR permitting process \nproposed last year as part of the Acid Rain Program. These revisions would \ninclude the following provisions:\n\n* Allowing the use of a single permit for multiple sources that are owned by \none entity\n\n* Eliminating the requirement for a permit for the construction of new \nelectric transmission lines\n\n* Including measures to reduce greenhouse gases\n\nWe are seeking comments on both sets of proposals. \n\nYou can access our proposal on the Internet at www.epa.gov/nsr/regs/proposal.htm. \nIf you would like to submit comments, you may do so via e-mail (addressed \nto nsrcfed@epamail.epa.gov), fax (number available at \nwww.epa.gov/nsr/regs/proposal.htm), or regular mail (see contact information \nbelow). Please direct your comments to the Office of Air Quality Planning and \nStandards (OAQPS), Attn: NSR Regulatory Development Group, Mail Code 4510M, \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460.\n\nPlease include the name of the publication in the subject line of your \ncomment. If you want us to consider your comment in developing a final \nrulemaking, please indicate that in your letter.\n\nFor additional information regarding these proposals, please contact Paul \nDietz (303-97",

I've been speaking with Jim Derrick about this, and he has assured me that he will work closely with our legal department to ensure that Enron's interests remain protected.  He also said that he would be happy to call you as soon as possible to discuss this further.  I hope this is satisfactory for you.

Unfortunately, however, you have it wrong.  It was\nnot my intention to communicate with you directly through Eric.  I have had\nno contact whatsoever with any attorneys representing Enron.  Your message\nis a bit disconcerting in that it suggests that Enron's legal team may have\nbeen making such inquiries without my knowledge or consent.  In fact, I am\ncurrently in litigation with Enron and have no desire to engage in any\ncommunications with its lawyers unless they serve me with discovery requests.\n\nAs I have previously stated, the only communication between the two of us\noccurred over a year ago when you called me about the possibility of\nrepresenting us in connection with a deal regarding the sale of natural gas\nto India.  As I recall, you indicated that you were interested in pursuing\nthis matter, but that we should wait until after the election.  This\nappears to be exactly what has occurred. \n\nAt any rate, if you wish to communicate with me directly, then you need to\ndo so by way of an e-mail or fax.  However, I must emphasize that I will not\nrespond to phone calls or messages left at my office.  If you want to talk\nwith me, you need to put something in writing.  My fax number is 713-230-6113\nand my e-mail address is dan_feather@enron.com.  Until I hear otherwise, I\nwill assume that you are still not ready to meet with us.
