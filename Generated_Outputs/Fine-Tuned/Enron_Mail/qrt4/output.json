The project would be located\nin New Jersey, where EnviroStar is based.\n\nThe technology used to convert crude oil into gasoline at the\noil sands involves burning the petroleum and releasing it as a\nsmoke stack. But the process releases dangerous levels of carbon\nmonoxide and hydrogen sulfide. A pilot plant being built in New\nJersey would use biofuels instead, and would reduce greenhouse\ngases by up to 80 percent, according to estimates made by Envirorstar\nand Enron.\n\n\"It's one of those things that you can look back at and say we\nwere early adopters,\" said Michael Olsen, chief executive officer\nof EnviroStar. \"We're looking at this because we want to be\npartners with our customers.\"\n\nOlsen said he hopes his company will begin producing biofuel\nthis year, and eventually make it available to other refineries\nnationwide. He said he expects to start building the facility within\nthe next two weeks.\n\n\"I think there are some great opportunities here,\" Olsen said.\n\"We just need to take advantage of them.\"\n\nEnviroStar is using a variety of technologies to turn biomass --\nsuch as corn stover (straw) and switchgrass -- into ethanol.\nThose processes include fermentation and distillation, and the\nethanol is then converted into gasoline.\n\nThe company plans to build a $4 million pilot plant in Newark,\nNew Jersey. Once the facility is complete, it could produce 5\nmillion gallons per day of bioethanol. That would make it one of the\nlargest producers of bioethanol in the United States.\n\n\"This isn't rocket science,\" Olsen said. \"But it's also not\nsomething that's easy to do.\"\n\nIf successful, the facility could help spur development of\nsimilar facilities around the country.\n\n\"There are still a lot of unknowns,\" Olsen said. \"And we don't\nhave the capacity to handle all the volume we'll need.\"\n\nOlsen said the facility is expected to cost between $100 million\nto $150 million. He said he hopes the facility can be completed\nwithin five years.\n\n\"We have to have the money to do it, and we have to have the\nsupport of the communities where we live,\" Olsen said. \"But if\nwe do it right, it should be possible to make it work.\"\n\nOlsen said the goal is to produce 3 billion gallons of bioethanol\nper year.\n\n\"That's the kind of commitment we've made,\" Olsen said. \"It's\ngoing to be hard, but I think we're going to get there.\"\n\nOlsen said the facility is expected to employ about 50 people when\nit opens. He said EnviroStar expects to break ground in June.\n\n\"We're excited about what we've done so far,\" Olsen said. \"And\nwe hope we'll continue to make progress.\"",

These communities provide \nadditional residential development potential.  Also, the site is within 1 \nmile of Interstate 45, which provides easy access to Houston and other \npopulation centers in Texas.\n\nThe property is zoned for commercial use under the City of Willis Zoning Ordinance.\n\nThe proposed project consists of a multi-phased development plan of \napproximately 1,800 single family homes, a retail center and an industrial \npark.  The first phase of the project would consist of 65 lots for single \nfamily housing and approximately 2 acres of land for the retail center.  The \nsecond phase would include construction of 65 additional single family home \nlots and approximately 6 acres of land for the retail center.  The third and \nfinal phases would include construction of an additional 105 single family \nhome lots and approximately 6 acres of land for the retail center.  A 200 \nacre site is proposed for the industrial park. \n\nThere are no known environmental issues associated with this site.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions concerning this project.\n\n\nRegards,\nDebra Perlingiere\nEnron North America Corp.\nLegal Department\n1400 Smith Street, EB 3885\nHouston, Texas 77002\ndperlin@enron.com\nPhone 713-853-7658\nFax  713-646-3490\n\n----- Forwarded by Debra Perlingiere/HOU/ECT on 09/12/2000 11:26 AM -----\n\n\tKenneth Lay\n\t09/12/2000 09:42 AM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Cliff Baxter/HOU/ECT@ECT, David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Janet R \nDietrich/HOU/ECT@ECT, James A Hughes/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Jeffrey McMahon/HOU/ECT, \nJeffrey Sherrick/Corp/Enron, Mark Frevert/NA/Enron, Martin P \nLuce/Corp/Enron, Mike J Miller/HOU/ECT, Raymond Bowen/HOU/ECT, Richard \nShapiro/HOU/EES, Robert H George/Corp/Enron, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES, Tom \nGros/HOU/ECT, Wanda Curry/HOU/ECT\n\t\t cc: Allison Gleaves/HOU/ECT@ect, Ann M Schmidt/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Brenda F \nHerod/HOU/ECT@ECT, Carolyn George/Corp/Enron",

The following are some highlights from those conversations:\n\nEnronOnline has been profitable every month since October 1999.  In addition, there have been numerous periods during that time when the company was not operating at full capacity but still made money each day.  During those periods, the revenue per hour was higher than when the system was fully operational.  The average daily revenue over the past year has been $50 million.\n\nThe employees interviewed said they were proud to be part of an organization that had never missed a payment to any counterparty.\n\nThe employees interviewed also said they were proud of the fact that EnronOnline was the first company to enter the eCommerce space.  They said they enjoyed being innovators.\n\nMost of the employees interviewed indicated they would like to stay with the company through the bankruptcy process if possible.  However, they said that they believed that most of their colleagues would look elsewhere to find employment opportunities.  Many expressed concerns about how long the bankruptcy process could last.  Some worried that Enron would lose its competitive edge while other companies move into the marketplace.  Others said they feared the company might suffer losses similar to those of other online ventures.\n\nMany of the employees interviewed said they felt strongly about continuing to support the company's charitable activities.  They said they wanted to ensure that contributions made to date were maintained, even though those contributions could no longer be deducted on employee income tax returns.\n\nOur conversations with employees suggested that they believe that the company's management team has not communicated well enough with employees.  Employees told us that they did not feel well informed about the status of the company and about what steps the company was taking to resolve its financial situation.  Most employees indicated that they had not read the letter from the board of directors that was distributed on Monday.  A few employees expressed concern about whether the board of directors had acted properly.\n\nEmployees generally seemed positive about the announcement that Kenneth Lay had resigned as chairman and CEO of Enron.  They said they believed his departure would help the company restore its credibility.  Several employees noted that Lay's resignation appeared to be the right thing to do at this point in the company's history.  They said they believed he should take responsibility for the problems facing the company and step down.  One employee indicated that Lay had remained in place too long and that he should have left earlier.\n\nMost of the employees interviewed said they believed that the company's leadership had failed to make appropriate decisions regarding the company's finances.  They said they believed that the company had suffered because executives had not followed",

The goal of this page is to eliminate the need to remember an ID number and password.  The plan is to use the EOL customer database to obtain the necessary information from our internal systems.  Once we have all the data needed, we can generate a username and password.  This page will be used as a means to communicate with EOL customers that do not have direct access to EOL.\n\nThis page would also be helpful if someone needs to reset their password for EOL, but doesn't have immediate access to their userid.  We are currently testing the prototype for the logon page.  Please let us know if you have any comments or concerns about the proposed methodology.\n\nBrett Panes\nEnronOnline\nApplication Support\n(713) 853-4747\n\n\n << File: Logo.jpg >> \n<< File: NewLogon.jpg >> \n\n\nKim Watson\nx39985\nEnron Net Works\nApplication Support\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tFitzpatrick, Amy  \nSent:\tMonday, January 21, 2002 4:46 PM\nTo:\tPanes, Brett; Watson, Kimberly; Sullivan, Colleen\nCc:\tFitzpatrick, Amy; 'sullivanc@andrews-kurth.com'; 'mccormickd@andrews-kurth.com'\nSubject:\tEnron Online Logon Page\nImportance:\tHigh\n\nGood afternoon!\n\nWe are looking for some additional input on what would work best for our customers when they visit the new logon page for EOL.  There has already been quite a bit of discussion regarding this issue.  If anyone has further suggestions, please feel free to pass them along.  You may also call Brett Panes at (713) 853-4747.\n\nThe goal of the logon page is to make it easier for customers to access EOL.  We are trying to take away the necessity of knowing your login name and password.  In order to accomplish this task, we have devised two different methods of obtaining your login name and password.\n\nThe first method is to have the customer enter his/her Social Security Number into the field provided.  Then, a screen pops up which asks the following question, \"Are you a U.S. Person?\"  If the answer is yes, then the SSN will be verified against the EOL Customer Database.  If the SSN matches, then the customer will receive his/her login name and password.\n\nThe second method uses the customer's EOL username and password to access the logon page.  If the customer does not know his/her login name and password, he/she may click on the \"Forgot Your Password\" link.  A screen pops up which asks the following question, \"Is this your Username?\"  If the answer is yes",
    "The site is positioned at the end of the street, and is situated between \nthe residential areas on one side and a small park/green area on the other.  \nThe lot is currently zoned for single family dwellings.  There are 24 lots \nadjacent to the site which are presently vacant.  The owner's initial \nintention was to develop a small shopping center in order to provide the \nneighborhood with a convenient place to shop.  However, because the \nlocation is not ideally suited for this purpose, the site has been \nredesigned as a mixed-use development.  The site is now proposed to include \n15 residential units (which may be detached homes or townhouses), a community \ncenter, and 30,000 sq ft of retail space.\n\nThis concept would result in an increase in density from 3.2 DU/AC to 6.7 \nDU/AC.  There will be no parking provided by the City.  The number of spaces \nprovided will be 1 per 1,000 sq ft of gross floor area.  A total of 980 \nparking spaces will be required.  This includes 713 spaces for the residential \nunits, plus 100 additional spaces for the community center and 167 spaces \nfor the retail component.  It is expected that the majority of these \nspaces will be underground.  Because there will be significant traffic \ngenerating activities on the site, the developer has asked that the street \nnetwork be reconfigured prior to construction.  In addition, the developer \nhas requested that the roadways be designed to accommodate future expansion \nof the commercial uses.\n\nThe following is a summary of the changes proposed:\n\n- Change in land use designation - RMF-15 to MX-3\n- Reduced maximum height - 40 feet (to 3 stories)\n- Increased FAR - 3.0 to 5.5\n- Increase in residential density - 3.2 to 6.7 DU/AC\n- Reduction in number of required parking spaces - 345 to 980\n\nI have reviewed the staff report and the final draft of the PRC application \nand believe it addresses all issues satisfactorily.  I believe the proposed \ndevelopment is consistent with the principles outlined in the Livable \nCenters Plan.  I am also satisfied that the proposed changes do not significantly \naffect any of the environmental impacts identified in the EIS.  Therefore, I \nam recommending approval of the PRC application subject to appropriate \nconditions of approval.\n\nMy recommendation is summarized below:\n\nRecommend Approval with Conditions\n\n- Reduce height from 40 feet to 3 stories (approximately 30 feet)\n- Require 15% open space for both residential and nonresidential portions of \nthe project\n- Establish building setbacks of 30 feet along the eastern boundary\n- Restrict all new paving on the west side of the site\n- Require bicycle access from the site onto the adjacent street network\n- Establish a schedule of periodic inspections during the construction phase \nto ensure compliance with approved plans\n\nPlease contact me if you have any questions regarding my comments on this \napplication.

The USD index lost more than a full point,\nand is now nearing the 1.18 level (its lowest since December of last year).\nGasoline prices rose almost 3 cents per gallon, while heating oil was up by\nmore than half a cent per gallon.\n*US Natural Gas: Natgas futures were down about one-tenth of a cent on\nWednesday. Despite yesterday's small decline, the NYMEX natural gas\nfutures contract has still gained nearly $1 in the past two weeks.\n*Canadian Natural Gas: Canadian Natural Gas prices have also been higher\nrecently, gaining about 20% in the past four weeks. On Tuesday, Canadian\nNatgas futures traded at $3.99 per MMbtu, their highest levels since early\nJuly. We expect that Canadian prices will remain elevated until late summer\nor fall when storage refill season begins and inventories begin to rise.\n\n\n*OPEC Production: OPEC output edged lower in July, but still remains very\nhigh. While OPEC production increased slightly over the course of the first\nhalf of this year, it has remained relatively flat in recent months.\nProduction in July stood at 24.9 mbpd, down just 1.1 million bpd from June\nlevels. This represents an increase of only 0.4% from a year earlier. OPEC\nis expected to boost production again in September to help bring global\nsupplies back into balance with demand.\n\n\n*European Energy Markets: European energy markets continue to feel the\neffects of the strong US dollar. As mentioned above, the USD index has\ndeclined sharply since mid-May, bringing the euro to its highest level in\nnearly three years. Since then, all energy prices in Europe have risen sharply.\nEuropean crude is currently trading at $19.70 per barrel, a price that has not\nbeen seen since April of 1998. Gasoline has risen to 1.05 euros per liter, and\nheating oil is currently priced at 0.93 euros per liter. These prices are\napproximately 40% and 25%, respectively, above year-ago levels.\n\n\n*Brazilian Energy: Brazil's government recently approved a proposal to\nincrease domestic fuel prices by 40%. This is the second time in less than\ntwo years that the government has taken such action. It hopes to save\n$1 billion annually by increasing taxes on fuels. Fuel prices are now\nexpected to increase 40% starting next month, rising 10% each quarter thereafter\nthrough May of 2002. The government will introduce an adjustable petroleum\nprice mechanism which will allow it to raise prices if necessary. The move is\nlikely to be well received by international investors because it will improve\nthe country's fiscal position. However, the measure could have a negative effect\non consumer spending and economic growth in general.\n\n\n*Chinese Energy Markets: China's government has announced plans to increase\nfuel subsidies in order to allevi",

Select \"Enron On Line\" from the home page and you will find an archived press release that provides a good summary of what we have accomplished since launching E-commerce in August 1998.\n\nTo access the website:\thttp://home.enron.com/communications/pressroom/index.html\n\nFor those who may not have seen it, this is one of many recent articles about our successes to date.  \n\nThe Wall Street Journal Online - June 25, 2000\nE-Commerce Site Leads Energy Industry's Revolution\nBy KATHY KELLEY; WSJ.com reporter\nDALLAS -- One day last year, Paul Quilico was trying to buy a hedge fund for his firm when he found himself surfing the Web site of the world's largest energy trader. He had heard about Enron Corp.'s innovative online trading system, but he was surprised by how simple and user-friendly it was.\n\"It's kind of like Amazon.com,\" Mr. Quilico says.\nIndeed, if you are a financial trader, it's almost as if Amazon.com has come to the energy business. The Houston-based company launched its EnronOnline Internet site two years ago with a goal of selling energy commodities such as natural gas and electricity online. It now offers more than 40 different products to about 600 customers on five continents. Last year, it posted sales of $7.3 billion, up from $5 billion the previous year, making it the fastest growing part of Enron's business.\nNow, thanks to a successful partnership between two companies that don't normally do business together, EnronOnline is moving into another market: insurance. In April, it signed a deal to sell property-and-casualty insurance to small businesses through Prudential Insurance Co. of America, which is owned by Prudential Financial Inc., a unit of Prudential Securities Inc.\nA third market could follow later this summer when EnronOnline begins offering weather derivatives, futures contracts based on the likelihood that extreme weather conditions will occur.\nEnronOnline is changing the way people do business in the energy industry, which once moved slowly and cautiously, says Richard Shapiro, director of the Center for Information Technology and Management at Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management in Evanston, Ill. \"In the past, most transactions were done through middlemen. But the advent of electronic trading is allowing firms to deal directly with each other.\"\nEnron, whose business is based on buying and selling energy commodities and related financial instruments, pioneered this type of e-commerce. Now others are following suit. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. recently announced plans to launch an online marketplace called MSDBizNet.com, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is developing a similar service.\nBoth brokerage firms will offer stocks, bonds and mutual funds. They say they plan to expand their services to include energy commodities.\n\"We are going after the big boys here,\" says John Hackett, chief information officer at MSDA Capital Markets, a division of Morgan Stanley. \"We want to be the Wal-Mart of the securities business.\"\nGoldman Sachs says it is close behind. \"This is only the beginning of a new era in finance,\" says Robert Elliott, executive vice president and co-head of the Global Fixed Income, Currency & Commodities Division at Goldman Sachs.\nAs the energy industry grows increasingly competitive, companies have been looking for ways to streamline operations and improve efficiency. Some are already using computer networks to communicate with suppliers, but few are trading electronically. That's because most energy products must be physically delivered and can't be sold over the Internet.\nIn addition, many companies still rely on paper to conduct transactions. Purchases are typically made through negotiated deals between buyers and sellers. Once a purchase agreement is reached, the parties fax copies back and forth until all details are finalized.\nEnron's technology allows both sides to enter details of a transaction electronically. Whenever there is a change, a message is sent instantly to the other party. Buyers can also use Enron's system to monitor the status of pending orders.\nEnron began testing its Internet trading system in late 1997 with three other energy companies. After a year, the",

Among them are the three largest U.S. corporations by market value: Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM) and General Electric (GE).\n\nThese bellwethers have already set an upbeat tone for the quarterly reporting season.\n\nMicrosoft has been the surprise star thus far, having reported earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations and boosting its share price by 20% on Friday. It expects its annual revenue to grow by 25%. The company also said it was increasing its dividend to $1.20 per share from 75 cents.\n\nIBM had a better-than-expected fourth quarter, thanks to growth in services and software sales. That helped the company beat analyst estimates, though some analysts warned that the results were buoyed by \"one-time\" events.\n\nGeneral Electric posted an unexpected gain in its fourth-quarter profits, and said it expected to make money this year even if oil prices fall.\n\nIn addition to these blue chips, other large companies are posting good numbers.\n\nAmong them are Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), which reported higher revenues and earnings for its fiscal second quarter; Intel (INTC), whose earnings rose 33%, and Cisco Systems (CSCO), which saw its earnings jump 130%.\n\nNot every company is performing well. For instance, Merrill Lynch (MER), which reported lower earnings for its latest quarter, said it would cut back on some investment banking activities and lay off employees as part of a cost-cutting program.\n\nHere's what else we can expect:\n\n-- Companies will likely report mixed performances. Some sectors such as technology and consumer products will probably do very well, but others may be hurt by economic slowdowns in Asia and Europe.\n\n-- The financial sector is likely to post solid gains, especially after Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) announced their merger. Many analysts say that the deal will give the combined firm new opportunities to provide loans and investment advice.\n\n-- Insurance companies are likely to fare poorly. They face rising claims from the Sept. 11 attacks and are dealing with uncertainty over the impact of terrorism.\n\n-- Energy companies should benefit from soaring crude oil prices, while retailers will suffer from sluggish consumer spending.\n\n-- Oil companies will probably report big profits thanks to high oil prices. But they could also be hit by falling demand because of the weakening economy in the United States and abroad.\n\n-- Telecommunication stocks are expected to continue their downward slide amid competition from cable providers.\n\n-- Banks and brokerage firms will likely report strong profits despite lower trading volume.\n\n-- Industrial companies are expected to show mixed results, with steel producers likely doing well because of increased demand in China, India, Brazil and other emerging economies. But airplane manufacturers Boeing (BA) and McDonnell Douglas (DOL) are likely to report losses due to decreased demand for aircraft.\n\n-- Airlines are predicted to post losses due to higher fuel costs.\n\n-- Consumer-goods makers such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are expected to report stronger profit margins, helped by their ability to raise prices above inflation rates.\n\n-- Retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT) are likely to report improved performance during the holiday season, when shoppers bought more items than usual to save money on sales taxes.

A real estate broker can earn an average income of $52,000 per year. This is based on the median wage for all occupations in this field, which is $46,370 per year.

    "For a more comprehensive analysis, check out the \"T\" chart in the June \nissue of The Energy Daily.\n\nThe following articles are available to subscribers:\n\nPacific Gas and Electric Co. has asked FERC for permission to charge customers\nfor a $3.5 billion shortfall that has caused the utility to seek bankruptcy.\n\nPGE filed an emergency request with FERC late Wednesday seeking authority to\ncollect revenues from customers to pay its debts as it moves toward Chapter 11\nbankruptcy filing. PGE said that without such relief, it would not be able to\noperate or meet its obligations under state law. The utility said it faces\n$246 million in monthly expenses, including payment on bonds and interest on\nits debt.\n\nBy John O'Brien\n\nhttp://www.energydaily.com/daily.asp?storyID=17708&section=1&cat=3&slug=19953\n\nEnergy Department's new report says that while prices have fallen since early\nthis year, they remain historically high. However, a recent survey shows that\na majority of Americans are satisfied with their energy costs.\n\nU.S. energy prices have declined significantly since reaching their peak earlier\nthis year, but still remain at levels that many analysts consider unreasonably\nhigh, according to a report released by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).\n\nhttp://www.energydaily.com/daily.asp?storyID=17701&section=1&cat=3&slug=19954\n\nDemocratic Party leaders are calling for hearings into whether Enron Corp. is\nusing its influence to block legislation that would help consumers.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Dick Gephardt wants to know if executives at Houston-\nbased Enron have used their clout to stop a House bill from passing that he\nsaid would lower natural gas prices. Gephardt made his comments Tuesday after\nhe and other Democrats met with Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., chairman of the Senate\nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\nhttp://www.energydaily.com/daily.asp?storyID=17698&section=1&cat=3&slug=19955\n\nIn this article, the author says that the most important thing that President Bush\nand Congress can do for consumers is to get behind legislation that would open\nup competition in the natural gas industry so that rates won't skyrocket like\nthey did during California's crisis last winter.\n\nBy David Bower\n\nhttp://www.energydaily.com/daily.asp?storyID=17697&section=1&cat=3&slug=19956\n\nThis article states that despite a recent drop in gasoline prices, oil companies\nare still making record profits because of high demand for refined products,\nespecially diesel fuel.\n\nOil companies posted record profits in the first quarter, thanks to strong\ndemand for fuels worldwide, especially diesel fuel.\n\nhttp://www.energydaily.com/daily.asp?storyID=17695&section=1&cat=3&slug=19957\n\nThis article describes how the Western Hemisphere will need about $600 billion\nworth of infrastructure investment over the next decade just to keep up with\ngrowth.\n\nThe Western Hemisphere will require about $600 billion worth of infrastructure\ninvestment over the next decade just to keep up with growth, the International\nFinance Corporation (IFC) warned yesterday. IFC also urged governments to\nimplement policies to attract private sector participation in projects\nrequired to ensure economic development.\n\nhttp://www.energydaily.com/daily.asp?storyID=17693&section=1&cat=3&slug=19958\n\nThis article talks about the potential impact of high natural gas prices on the\nNortheast region's electricity markets.\n\nWith natural gas prices running at about three times their average levels of\nlast summer, the Northeast region could see an increase in electricity\ngenerating costs of 10 percent or more this year, according to consultant\nBlack & Veatch.\n\nhttp://www.energydaily.com/daily.asp?storyID=1",

We should be able to compare with them later. \n\nThe survey was administered in December and there were only 10 employees that\nresponded so it would seem that those respondents may not represent our group.\nWe did however have 2 people who reported that they had previously worked for\none of our peer companies (Dynegy). Those individuals also represented about\nhalf of the total number of responses. The rest of the respondents came from\nvarious places including the central desk. We will probably get better numbers\nif we try again next year.  \n\nThe questionnaire had some very generic questions that we could not answer such\nas \"What is your favorite food?\" which did not make much sense. We also did not\nget good answers to many of the questions since we did not have a standard set\nof procedures or processes in place. It seemed like a lot of the questions asked\nfor yes/no answers and we were not able to provide complete information. \n\nThis morning I talked to Susan Scott and she said that Enron has been working\non its own employee satisfaction survey which will be administered soon. She\nalso indicated that we might be able to get access to their data once it is\ncompleted. \n\nRegarding our own internal survey we should focus on getting a larger sample size\nfrom both the traders and schedulers to get a true representation of how we\ncompare",

I spoke with him last week about the problems that were going on out west.  He did not seem aware of the cash flow issues that you are referring to.  I would suggest that you try to find someone who knows what you are talking about.  It sounds like the situation may be getting worse and you should get an update as soon as possible.

As you know, the situation has become increasingly difficult over the past few months.  While we continue to work diligently to resolve these issues, it appears that they are only worsening.  According to David, the primary reason why things are becoming so difficult is because of the lack of information provided to us.  Since we do not receive a daily report from EWP regarding their operations, it becomes very difficult to track down the reasons behind their shortfalls.  The only way for us to effectively manage our business is to understand all aspects of theirs.\n\nAs you may already know, EWS has requested an increased level of communication between ETS and EWP.  David said that this request will help them identify areas where we can assist each other and possibly make the situation more efficient.  However, he stated that there is no set timeframe as to when this communication may begin.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me directly at x3-9603.

    "We recommend exploring our website at www.enron.com or www.enron.co.uk to learn more about the company that is currently undergoing a major financial restructuring and re-organization process.  The Company has recently announced the appointment of Ken Lay as Chairman of the Board, Jeff Skilling as President and CEO and Lou Plummer as CFO.  \n\nThe Company is working with its financial advisors on an out-of-court recapitalization plan which will provide for a new equity investor in Enron and provide existing shareholders with an opportunity to retain some portion of their ownership interest in the reorganized company.  Our ability to pursue this alternative is dependent upon raising sufficient cash through new financings to enable us to meet our obligations as they come due over the next several months.  \n\nIn the past week we have raised $250 million from Delta Power Ventures, LP and $100 million from Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc., but we need additional funding to be able to pay our bills while we work toward finalizing the recapitalization plan.  As you know, our wholesale energy trading business is one of the most successful businesses in America and one of the largest businesses in the world.  A significant portion of these earnings are used by the business to finance operations.  Once we have completed our recapitalization, we expect that the Company's financing structure will include much less reliance on short-term borrowings to finance our operating activities.  \n\nWe are continuing to discuss our situation with potential sources of capital and appreciate your continued support.\n\nKen Lay\nJeff Skilling\nLou Plumer\nEnron Board of Directors\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  This email address cannot be answered.

Thank you for your support.\nThe eBiz Team\n\nThis message was delivered using eMail Technology.  To learn more about this technology, click on the \"About eMail Technology\" link below.\nAbout eMail Technology\neMail Technology is a system that allows delivering of messages to multiple recipients simultaneously. It works by first collecting all addresses that belong to employees working within a specific organization unit (for example, a department). The list of addresses is stored in a special file called Distribution List. Then, when you want to send a message to all people belonging to a particular group, you only need to enter their address(es) into Distribution List field on Message Creation Form. After that, just click the Send button and your message will be sent automatically to all employees whose addresses are included in the distribution list.\n\nNote:\nMessage delivery time depends on the size of the distribution list. In general, one second per recipient should be sufficient to receive the message. However, if the list includes hundreds of recipients, some of them may not receive the message right away because they are offline or their mailboxes are full. They will receive the message later, as soon as they come online or free up enough space in their mailboxes.\n\nDistribution lists should be maintained by HR administrators. To view Distribution Lists currently used in your organization, click the link below.\nView Distribution Lists\n\nFor more detailed information about eMail Technology, including troubleshooting tips, click on the following link.\neMail Technology Help\n\nTo report any problems with this message, fill out the form at http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/report.asp.\nReport Problems\n<embed src=\"http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/email.asp?msg=0&uid=67926&lid=66788&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp",
