In her e-mail she indicated that, according to Dale Neuner, closing documents were not meant to serve as confirmations.  She also said that the forms should not be used unless the parties specifically requested them.\n\nStacey, in an earlier conversation with me, had indicated to me that, in her opinion, we should use the closing documents only when it makes sense to do so (i.e., in cases where the contracts contain very little detail).  This seems to be consistent with what Lisa wrote.  We all agree that it is important to make sure we do not misuse these forms.\n\nIf anyone else is aware of other situations that might require us to use the closing documents, please let me know.  The forms are available through the Legal Assistant group, but if we find ourselves in a situation where we want to use one of these forms, we should ask our counterparty whether they want us to use such form.  If they say yes, then we can request a copy of the form.  However, we must remember that the purpose of these forms is to provide language for certain closing events, not to serve as confirmations themselves.\n\nThanks!\nMelissa\n\nPS  -- Please note that the Enron Corp. Confirm Desk is now using the closing documents in their confirmations for certain transactions, particularly those involving mergers.  The Legal Department will be sending out the appropriate form to the appropriate desks once we have determined which ones are necessary.

    "We value the insights gained from your suggestions and feedback.  As a result, we are pleased to announce that an Associate/Analyst PRC has been scheduled for July 2001.\n\nThe purpose of this meeting is to provide an opportunity for supervisors to share information on the performance of their respective Associates/Analysts with the business units in which they work.  The Associate/Analyst PRC will include both written and verbal presentations by supervisors regarding:  1) Associate/Analyst development; and 2) Associate/Analyst performance.  This meeting provides an important forum to communicate performance expectations across Enron as well as to review performance.  It also serves to increase communication between the various functions within Enron and the business units.\n\nWe believe strongly in meritocracy and in rewarding high performers based upon their accomplishments.  However, we must be careful not to overlook individuals who may have had a difficult start or whose accomplishments were less obvious.  To address these issues, each supervisor is asked to submit two Associates/Analysts for consideration at the Associate/Analyst PRC.  These Associates/Analysts will be chosen by the supervisor and will represent the broad spectrum of Enron's Associates/Analysts.  Each supervisor will be able to choose one Associate/Analyst to highlight during his/her presentation.  Each supervisor should select his/her Associates/Analysts based upon the following criteria:\n\n? High potential\n? Contribution to the organization\n? Strong leadership skills\n? Outstanding performance in relation to peers\n? Potential to become future leaders\n\nIt is our expectation that all Associates/Analysts are contributing to the success of Enron.  While the Associate/Analyst PRC will serve to recognize outstanding contributions, it will also focus on providing additional training opportunities for Associates/Analysts who need assistance in developing their abilities.\n\nWe look forward to working with you in this endeavor.

I?m  very familiar with all of these issues having worked in  Sacramento as a lobbyist for Enron from 1996 through 2000.? My primary concern is that the  language used by the Commission in the final order does not take into account the  significant benefits of PX-type markets for consumers.? It  appears that the Commission is only considering the costs of the PX model and not  the benefits.? The fact is that without a market such as the one that was  created in California, the price paid to customers would be much higher.? The  average monthly price charged to customers during the height of the crisis  (January) was $300.? That figure could easily double if a market  were not present.? As the recent study of the Western electricity  crisis by UCLA suggests, this type of market is critical to ensuring  competitive electricity rates.? \n?\nThe fact is that California's wholesale power prices rose dramatically  after the state opened up its market to competition because the state  lost control over the market once it had allowed third parties to enter the  marketplace.? The market itself became chaotic and prices skyrocketed.?  This is what happens when you allow market forces to determine the price  of electricity.? \n?\nIf we are going to have an open, competitive market in the West, it has to  be designed to prevent the kind of chaos that occurred in California.?  One way to do so is to implement a PX-style market.?  Another  possibility is to require all utilities in the region to use the same price  index.? \n?\nIn any event, the PX should remain a viable option for states that want  to protect their citizens from price spikes.? The Commission needs to  recognize the benefits of the PX and work to ensure that states can use  it to achieve lower cost electricity for their citizens.\n?\nBill Votaw\nCalifornia State Director\nEdison Electric Institute\n916-447-5407\n - Bill Votaw.vcf\n - Bill Votaw.doc\n - 052301_PX_Order.rtf\n - 052301_PX_Order.pdf\n - 052301_PX_Order.txt\n - 052301_PX_Order.html\n - 052301_PX_Order.wps\n - 052301_PX_Order.txt\n - 052301_PX_Order.html\n - 052301_PX_Order.wps\n - 052301_PX_Order.wpd\n - 052301_PX_Order.odt\n - 052301_PX_Order.doc\n - 052301_PX_Order.docx\n - 052301_PX_Order.xls\n - 052301_PX_Order.xlsx\n - 052301_PX_Order.csv\n - 052301_PX_Order.xml\n - 052301_PX_Order.html\n - 052301_PX_Order.htm\n - 052301_PX_Order.xhtml\n - 052301_PX_Order.html\n - 052301_PX_Order.xhtml\n - 052301_PX_Order.rft\n - 0",

There may be a time when it may be\nnecessary for us to reduce the amount of credit extended to Enron based upon\ntheir current financial condition.  If this were to happen, we could\ntherefore not extend credit to you without your being required to pay cash\nfor goods received.  If this happens, we would be happy to prepare monthly\nstatements showing the status of your account.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else that I can do for you.

It looks like Reliant\nhasn't had any problems getting those records so far.\n\nAlso, he said that they did not expect any issues with the interconnection\ncontract (again, as long as everything is signed by both parties).

My job at Enron is extremely demanding, but I really enjoy the challenges presented each and every day.  I've been working here for nearly five years now, and although I love what I do, I am always looking for ways to expand my skills, learn new things, etc.  The research group seems to be the perfect fit for me, not only because of its high level of intellectual stimulation, but also due to its potential financial rewards.  It seems to be a win-win situation all around.\n\nSecondly, I would love to speak with Mr. McMichael when he returns to Houston.  I am interested in hearing more about his experiences and vision for the company.  I think it would be a good idea to speak with him before making any final decisions, as I am sure he will have valuable insight into how to best utilize this research group within Enron.\n\nAgain, thank you for thinking of me.  I look forward to speaking with Mr. McMichael soon.\n\nRegards,\n\nLexi Elliott\nEnron Americas-Office of the Chair\n(713) 853-9402\n(713) 646-3480 (cellular)\nlexi.elliott@enron.com\n<< File: CMC Research Memo.doc >> \n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tThomas, Phillip M.  \nSent:\tThursday, October 25, 2001 5:08 PM\nTo:\tElliott, Lexi\nSubject:\tRE: Enron Research Project\n\nDear Lexi,\n\nGood afternoon.  This note is in response to your inquiry regarding the Enron Research Project.  As you know, we are currently attempting to determine whether the services offered by the CMC Research Group can assist us in improving our ability to accurately predict the direction of natural gas prices.\n\nOur initial analysis suggests that their approach may indeed be successful.  We are scheduled to meet with them next week to further explore their offerings and assess their capabilities.  Although we believe that they can provide some value to Enron, we are currently evaluating several other options that may prove to be even more beneficial to our business needs.\n\nWe will keep you informed as we move forward on this project.  Thank you again for your interest.\n\nBest regards,\nPhillip Thomas\nVice President of Risk Management\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tElliott, Lex",

If you do not know how to scan to PDF, we can assist you.\n2)  Whenever possible, documents being printed should be scanned to PDF first so they can be printed on an Enron printer using black & white paper.  If a document is already printed on color paper or if it contains color images, it must be printed at an outside location such as FedEx Office Kinko's.\n3)  If you need to use a local printer, please see one of the following people:\n\na)  In EB and ECNT, please contact either Kim Ward or Bill Bradford.\nb)  In ECD, please contact Jennifer Fraser.\nc)  In ENA and EGM, please contact Leslie Reeves.\n\nIf you have any questions about these procedures, please contact me at ext. 57809.\n\nThank you in advance for your cooperation.\n\nSteve\nx57809\n\np.s.

    "For more individualized guidance, please email us at \nsales@energyhedge.com or call our Sales Desk (408) 975-6225 to speak with a \nmember of our sales team about your needs and how we can help.  \n\nWe offer the following products:\n\nHEDGE - A daily commodity position manager that gives you the opportunity to \ntake advantage of market dislocations while protecting your capital from \nunexpected price movements.  The HEDGE is the only product in the industry \nthat uses options as its primary trading instrument for maximum profit \npotential.  It can be used on any liquid commodity including oil, gasoline, \nnatural gas, coal, gold, silver, copper, lumber, and cotton.\n\nThe HEDGE's goal is to provide investors with protection against unexpected \nprice moves by creating an insurance policy on their investment positions.\n\nThe HEDGE provides you with three distinct strategies for risk management:\n\n1.  Positional Risk Management -- Protecting your long position from adverse \nmoves\n\n2.  Short Position Risk Management -- Protecting your short position from \nadverse moves\n\n3.  Relative Value Risk Management -- Taking advantage of relative value \nopportunities between different markets\n\nFor example, if you own a long position in natural gas and want to take \nadvantage of any potential move down in oil prices, then you can use this \nproduct to create a \"short\" position in oil.  If oil moves up, your long \nposition in natural gas will benefit; conversely, if oil moves down, your \nlong position in natural gas will suffer.\n\nThe HEDGE allows you to establish a long position in one commodity and a short \nposition in another commodity within the same account using the same cash \nflow.  This is possible because each strategy operates independently in \nopposite directions so when one goes up, the other goes down and vice versa.\n\nIf you are interested in purchasing the HEDGE, please complete the following \nforms and fax them back to us at (408) 975-6225.  We will then contact you \nwithin one business day to answer any questions you may have.  Thank you for \nyour interest in EnergyHedge.com!\n\nThe HEDGE Application Form",

The changes include\nan increase in the price cap to $160, a change in how the price cap is\ncalculated, and an additional payment of $1 million per year for the term of\nthe agreement.\n\n2) EES has not responded.\n\n3) Last Friday (September 22), EES' lawyers met with GE's lawyers and tried\nto work out the details.  During this meeting, EES' lawyer told GE's lawyer\nthat there would be no problem with the price cap.  However, they did not\nresolve all of the issues because they were unable to reach an agreement about\nthe other two points (payment of $1 million per year and calculation of the\nprice cap).\n\n4) In light of the fact that EES had agreed to the price cap, GE decided to\nsend a new letter to EES saying that unless EES agreed to pay $1 million per\nyear and redo the way the price cap is calculated, then GE was withdrawing its\nproposal to enter into the transaction.\n\n5) This led to a second meeting between GE's lawyers and EES' lawyers.  At\nthis point, EES' lawyer informed GE's lawyer that EES would not agree to pay\n$1 million per year and also would not agree to redo the formula for the price\ncap.\n\n6) At this point, Mike and I both suggested to EES' lawyers that they should\nconsider making concessions on one or both of these items so as to move the\ntransaction forward.  We also suggested that perhaps EES should put together\na proposal that contains the price cap and the $1 million per year but that\ndoesn't contain the formula for calculating the price cap.  If GE doesn't like\nthe formula, EES can offer to revise it.  This seems like a reasonable compromise\nto me.  But, EES' lawyers said that they were unwilling to make such a\ncompromise.\n\nAt that point, I asked whether there was anything else that we could do to\ntry to keep the deal alive.  It turns out that we may still have something in\nour favor.  Specifically, the deal was contingent upon Enron's ability to sell\nits power to PG&E.  As you recall, PG&E recently filed for bankruptcy and the\nState regulators are currently investigating whether PG&E will be allowed to\ncontinue operations.  Because of this uncertainty, PG&E might decide to back\nout of the deal with Enron before the end of the 6 month period.  Therefore,\nwe might want to consider negotiating with GE over the price cap issue until\nPG&E makes a decision about whether it will continue doing business with us.\nHowever, if PG&E decides to stay in the market, then we will be in a better\nposition to bargain with GE over the price cap issue.\n\nAnyway, those are the facts as I understand them from talking to the lawyers\nat Gibbs & Bruns.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\nThanks,\n\nBruno\n\nPS -- Saurabh, I will try to talk to you tomorrow.  Hope",

For example, do we have any responsibility if a customer does not pay an invoice due to fraud?  Are there any liability limits or caps that apply?  What about errors or omissions by the traders that cause financial losses to customers?  Is Enron responsible for any costs or fees associated with legal action initiated by customers?\n\nAs you can see, we need more clarification before we can proceed with the necessary changes in EOL and business processes.  If there are no existing policies or procedures that cover these situations, then we will need to develop them.  In addition, if there are any documents that describe what EOL does and doesn't do, then we should be provided access to those documents.

Liquidation Procedures\n \nWe are currently working on a new set of liquidation procedures which will include the following:\n\na.  The ability to put the trader on hold while the dispute is being resolved with counterparty.  This will allow us to avoid putting the trader into a position where he is stuck taking a side until resolution of the dispute is reached.\nb.  A review process that will involve the Legal Department prior to liquidating a trade.\nc.  An automatic liquidation process that will occur once the disputed trade has been held up by the trader for a period of time.\nd.  The ability to automatically freeze accounts after a specified number of days.\ne.  A procedure for determining the amount of money that is owed to each party when liquidating a disputed trade.\n\nThere is also a document available on the intranet site entitled \"Liquidation Procedure\" which discusses the current procedures.\n\n2.  Errors & Omissions Policy\n\nCurrently, we have a policy which covers this area.  However, it does not cover all areas that I know you want covered.  We are currently looking into purchasing",

We pay them for all our gas use at the end of each month (no matter how much it is) so that our bills don't fluctuate from month to month.  We find their service to be outstanding!\n\nSouthwestern Energy - This company has been good to work with in setting up new accounts and getting them set up correctly.\n\nBritish Petroleum - For our oil usage.\n\nThanks again for sending this information.\n\nMike\n--------------------------\nSent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jeff Dasovich [mailto:Jeff_Dasovich@enron.com]\nSent: Wednesday, May 23, 2001 4:27 PM\nTo: mikemcgovern@pge.com\nSubject: Re: FW: RE: Cash Flow\n\n\n\nHi Mike--\n\nJust wanted to check and see if you got my response?

Please let us know if you would like to schedule such a presentation.\n\nThank you.\n\nEnron Global Markets\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of questions that were submitted via e-mail and through our website (www.enron.co.uk/vision) by those who attended the investor conference last week in Houston. We have tried to provide answers to these questions where possible, but if there are any further queries, please contact us on the above e-mail address.\n\nWhat are the details of the European commodities trading businesses?\n\nEuropean Natural Gas trading began in Q2 2000 with a single market - Germany. As of 31 December 2000, European Natural Gas had grown to include seven countries representing more than 35% of European gas demand (see figure below).\n\nIn addition to Germany, we now trade physical natural gas into the UK, Belgium, France, Austria, Italy and Switzerland. These markets represent over 35% of total European gas demand. We also trade financial products in all nine countries, and offer weather derivatives in six.\n\nThe European Power business launched in October 2000 with Germany and Spain. At year end 2000, we had expanded to include five European power markets representing approximately 30% of total European electricity demand.\n\nWe continue to build out Europe's largest wholesale energy trading company. We are currently trading over 35% of European gas demand and over 30% of European electricity demand. \n\nHow many people are working on EnronOnline?  What are the plans for growth?\n\nAs of 31 December 2000, EnronOnline has 282 employees. We expect to increase headcount to 340 by the end of 2001.\n\nOur goal is to grow EnronOnline to become the world's leading online commodity trading platform. Today it trades approximately $2 billion per day in North American and European natural gas and power products. It is our aim to double the size of our business every twelve months. We believe this is achievable because of the unique business model we have developed around our proprietary technology. \n\nWhen will we see EnronOnline offering other products and other regions?\n\nEnronOnline has been established to become the world's leading online commodity trading platform. Our initial focus is on natural gas and power. This will be followed by coal and then by emissions, metals and other commodities. We plan to launch new products and introduce new geographies on a regular basis. For example, our first European product - natural gas - was launched in August 2000, with electricity being introduced in November 2000.\n\nWill there be a separate EGM office in London? If so when?\n\nYes. There will be a separate EGM office in London. Plans are underway to establish a base in the city by mid-year.\n\nIs the new EGM London office located near the existing EBS London office?  \n\nNo. The two offices are not located together.\n\nWhat is the structure of the management team in London?\n\nThe current members of the London management team are: \n\nPeter Brett, Managing Director \nMichael Cummings, Vice President \nJohn Craighead, Senior Manager \nKevin Presto, Vice President \nMark Tawney, Senior Manager \nJonathan Whitehead, Senior Manager \nNicholas O'Day, Senior Manager \nMark Tawney, Senior Manager \nChris Gaskill, Manager \nTom Mclaughlin, Manager \nSarah Higgins, Manager \n\nAndy Zipper, Vice Chairman\n\nThese individuals will report to Andy Zipper, Vice Chairman of Enron Global Markets.\n\nWho will be responsible for EGM's European hedge fund activities?\n\nBruce Suffield",

    "We actively encourage your suggestions and feedback about the new online \nbenefits system.

In response, we have \ncreated a new feature on our website that lists all the benefits available to \neach employee group.  This list includes links to specific benefit programs' \nwebsites, as well as descriptions of each program.  You can find this listing \nat http://benefits2000.enron.com/index.asp.

To access the print \noption, click on the printer icon at the top of any page on the site (the one \nthat looks like a little letter).  Once you do this, you can print just the \ninformation that appears on that page, or you can print all the pages in \nthe section by clicking on \"Print All\" near the bottom of the page.

A copy is being distributed by facsimile and should be available shortly on FERC's website at www.ferc.fed.us. This message does not contain any comments on the contents of the order but rather provides a brief description of what the order requires.\nThe order establishes four new Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) in New England, New York, Midwest, and California. The order also includes an immediate implementation schedule for these four RTOs that requires their establishment by December 11, 2001.  The order directs FERC staff to work with state regulators to complete the necessary actions to implement MOPRs for the RTOs. MOPRs would apply to investments in transmission facilities made after October 1, 2001.  However, the order does not include any discussion of MOPRs for other types of investment in transmission facilities.  Finally, the order requires that all parties file with FERC within thirty days a detailed accounting of actual costs for construction, operation, maintenance and management of transmission assets for each year since 1999.\nWe will send out a further advisory when we receive the order and have had an opportunity to fully evaluate the order. Please feel free to call if you wish to discuss. Jim Baker 202-383-2106\n\n______________________________________\nThis e-mail message and any attach",

The following questions and answers are based \non recent customer inquiries and general interest.\n\n\n1. How many users does NEON have?\n\nNEON has approximately 7,000 unique users.\n\n2. What time do the markets close?\n\nAll markets open at 6:00 AM Central Time and close at 5:30 PM Central Time.\n\n3. Does NEON trade outside of its core business hours?\n\nYes, NEON trades European power 24-hours a day, seven days a week.  Trading \nin other products may also occur outside of core business hours, although \nsuch activity is infrequent.\n\n4. Is there an auction market in Europe?\n\nNo, there is no formal auction market in Europe.  There are various mechanisms \nused by traders and their counterparties to facilitate transactions when they \nare not matched during normal trading hours.\n\n5. Are all markets available for trading through NEON?\n\nNo, some markets are not available to US residents because of regulatory \nrestrictions.  Other markets are not available to non-Europeans due to \nlanguage or cultural issues.\n\n6. Can a European product be traded from the Houston office?\n\nThere is no mechanism for trading European products from the Houston office.  \nThe only way to transact a transaction involving an asset located outside of \nthe United States is to send someone overseas to represent the company and \ntransact the deal.\n\n7. How can a European product be traded from the Houston office?\n\nA European product cannot be traded from the Houston office.  However, a \nproduct could be created that is denominated in Euros but is physically \ndelivered in the United States.  In addition, a counterparty who wishes to \ntrade a European product could post collateral with Enron North America Corp. \nthat would allow them to continue to trade even if they were unable to \nreceive payment from a European entity.\n\n8. Can a European product be traded from the London office?\n\nYes, any European product could be traded from the London office.\n\n9. Who pays for the trader's travel expenses to Europe?\n\nTravel expenses are paid by the department in which the employee works.  All \nemployees are encouraged to check with their supervisor before making any \nnon-work related travel arrangements so that costs associated with such \nactivities may be properly charged to the appropriate account.\n\n10. Does NEON pay for travel expenses to Europe?\n\nNEON pays for travel expenses for employees who are performing work for NEON.  \nAny employee traveling for personal reasons should make his/her own \narrangements and pay for such exp",

This includes work \nsuch as reviewing documents, preparing resolutions and other matters relating \nto meetings of boards of directors, filing articles of incorporation and \namendments thereto, preparing bylaws, board minutes, meeting minutes, etc., \nreviewing contracts and leases, and providing routine advice on day-to-day \nbusiness issues.  With respect to some entities, this list may be expanded \nupon request of the appropriate officer of that entity.  The general counsel \nis also authorized to represent the subsidiary or affiliate before various \ngovernment agencies, such as the Federal Communications Commission, if the \nrepresentation does not involve litigation.  The general counsel also has \nauthority to prepare pleadings and briefs in connection with litigation in \nwhich the entity is a party or otherwise representing the entity in \nlitigation in which the entity is not a party provided that the work is \nperformed under the direction of an attorney of the corporate law department.\n\nIn addition to performing these types of services free of charge, the general \ncounsel of any Enron company is also authorized to provide the following \nservices to all Enron companies without charge:\n\nReview of transaction documents, including lease agreements, loan \nagreements, sale-leaseback transactions, purchase and sales agreements, \ncontracts, etc.  This service is intended primarily to allow the company \nand its officers and employees to obtain a second opinion from the corporate \nlaw department prior to signing the document, but may also include drafting \nthe transaction documents.\n\nProviding \"white collar criminal defense\" services to Enron companies and \ntheir officers and employees in response to allegations of violations of \nFederal securities laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, mail fraud \nstatutes, money laundering statutes, or other white collar criminal \nmatters.  This type of assistance generally requires the person receiving \nassistance to cooperate fully with the investigators and prosecutors, \nprovide requested documentation and information, and generally assist in \ndeveloping facts and arguments in support of the position taken by the \ncompany.  The provision of this service may require that the company waive \nits privilege against disclosure of confidential communications between the \ncompany and its outside counsel regarding the matter.\n\nRepresenting Enron companies and their officers and employees in response to \nsubpoenas seeking testimony or production of documents, and in civil actions \nin federal court brought by government regulatory agencies.

Enron Corp., et al., Case No. H-00-3560, US District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division.  This case involves Mr. Smith, former employee at Southwestern Electric Power Company (\"SEPC\"), which was acquired by Enron in 1997.  SEPC filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in October 1995.  In May 1997, Enron sold substantially all of its assets of SEPC, including the property owned by SEPC where Mr. Smith worked.  Mr. Smith filed a claim against Enron in the bankruptcy court alleging that he had suffered discrimination because of his race when he lost his job after the sale.  The bankruptcy trustee approved Mr. Smith's claim in April 2000.  Mr. Smith then sued Enron Corporation and certain individuals employed by Enron in federal district court in Houston, Texas in March 2001.  We have requested that the District Court dismiss the claims brought by Mr. Smith.  A motion hearing is scheduled for January 22, 2002.  We need to determine if we will offer settlement before the motion hearing.  It appears that Mr. Smith is seeking compensatory damages from Enron in excess of $1 million.\n\nEnron Corp., et al. v. City of San Antonio, Case No. SA-CV 01-0574-WS, Bexar County District Court, Texas.  This is an action involving a dispute over the ownership of certain natural gas pipelines and other facilities located within the City of San Antonio.  The City has filed suit against Enron, Enterprise Products Partners, and various individuals associated with them.
