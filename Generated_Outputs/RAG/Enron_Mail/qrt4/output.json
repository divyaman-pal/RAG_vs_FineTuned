It connects the PG&E system to the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) system.  The facility has several lines with different capacities, including Line 300, which has a capacity of 1.14 bcf/d.  In 1997, PG&E executed an interconnect agreement with SoCalGas, which allocated capacity on Line 300 to SoCalGas for the benefit of its customers.  Since then, PG&E has retained some capacity on Line 300 for its own core customers, but a significant portion of the capacity has been allocated to contract transport customers.  I am unsure of the exact capacity allocation between PG&E's core customers and contract transport customers at the current time.  However, I believe that PG&E has discretion over how to use the capacity it retains for its core customers, and can nominate and schedule volumes at Topock on a daily basis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "The message is a reminder notice for a training session on the ENA Supervisory Curriculum.
