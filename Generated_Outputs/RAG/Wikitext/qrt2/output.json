When the song was released in 1984, it was seen as a bold and provocative statement that challenged traditional values and attitudes towards sex and sexuality. The lyrics, which are deliberately ambiguous and open to interpretation, have been interpreted in different ways by different people.\nFor some, the song is a celebration of sexual freedom and the joy of discovery. The line \"I like it like that\" is often seen as a declaration of independence and a rejection of societal expectations. For others, the song is a commentary on the objectification of women and the commodification of sexuality. The repeated use of the word \"like\" is seen as a way of reinforcing the idea that women are objects to be desired and possessed.\nRegardless of how one interprets the song, it is clear that \"Like a Virgin\" is a cultural touchstone that has had a lasting impact on popular culture. The song's themes of sexuality, identity, and rebellion continue to resonate with listeners today, and it remains one of", "Sure!

The waterwheel, also known as a \"hydro-mechanical device,\" was used to pump water from lower elevations to higher irrigation planes. The device consisted of a large, circular wheel with ten bamboo watering tubes fastened at its perimeter. The tubes were submerged in water, and as the wheel turned, it created a suction effect that drew water from the lower tubes and lifted it to the higher tubes for irrigation.\nThe waterwheel was an improvement over earlier methods of irrigation, which relied on manual labor to transport water from lower elevations to higher fields. The waterwheel greatly increased the efficiency of irrigation, allowing farmers to irrigate larger areas more quickly and easily. It also enabled farmers to irrigate their fields during the night, when the water was cooler and more comfortable for the crops.\nThe development of the waterwheel was not limited to the Han dynasty.

The recording was done using a combination of live takes and overdubs, and the final mix was done by Giles Martin, who is known for his work on the Beatles' catalog. The song is a showcase for the musicians' skills and creativity, and it features many solos and improvisational sections.

He is best known for his portraits of famous writers and artists, including William Wordsworth. Harvey was commissioned to take photographs of Wordsworth in 1840, and the resulting images are some of the earliest and most famous portraits of the poet.\nIn terms of the context of Wordsworth's poetry, Harvey's photographs provide an interesting contrast to the way Wordsworth's poetry is often perceived. While Wordsworth's poetry is known for its emphasis on nature and the emotional experiences of everyday life, Harvey's photographs present a more formal and staged image of the poet. The lighting in each shot is carefully arranged to emphasize Wordsworth's features, and the images have a sense of grandeur and importance that is at odds with the more intimate and personal nature of Wordsworth's poetry.\nIt is worth noting that the technology available for photography at the time was still relatively new and developing, and the images produced by Harvey and other photographers of the era were often", "Of course!

Here is more information about the Maya numeral system:\ncontext: The basic number system consisted of a dot to represent one and a bar to represent five. By the Postclassic period, a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period, other glyphs were used. The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 using a combination of these symbols. The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give <unk> plus <unk> plus <unk>.

This experience instilled in her the sense of \"always straddling two countries...but not belonging to either culture.\"\nCisneros's work deals with the formation of Chicana identity, exploring the challenges of being caught between Mexican and Anglo American cultures. She faced misogynist attitudes in both cultures and experienced poverty, which she addresses in her writing. Cisneros's insightful social critique and powerful prose style have earned her recognition far beyond Chicano and Latino communities.

The idea of multiple realizability is the notion that different species or entities can have the same mental states or properties, despite having different physical or neural structures. This idea is often discussed in the context of the neural correlates of consciousness, or the study of the brain structures and processes that are responsible for our subjective experience of the world.\nIn the context of the debate between type identity theorists and functionalists, Putnam (1988) argued that the latter group's position is more plausible, as it allows for the possibility of multiple realizability. He used examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate his point, asking whether it is likely that the brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain or other mental states in the same way as humans do. If they do not share the same brain structures, they cannot share the same mental states and properties.\nPutnam then took his argument a step further, asking about hypothetical entities such as alien beings, artificially intelligent robots, and other silicon-based life forms.

They are gentle and will usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them, but physical contact is normally discouraged as their ticks can be vectors to Rocky Mountain spotted fever.\nThe European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) tasked a park in Sussex, England to keep the studbook for capybaras, to monitor captive populations in Europe. The studbook includes information about all births, deaths, and movements of capybaras, as well as how they are related.\nCapybaras are farmed for meat and skins in South America.

Regurgitation is a common defense mechanism used by many insects and other arthropods to deter predators.

The vomit of noctuid moths has repellent and irritant properties that help to deter predator attacks.\n* The Malaysian exploding ant is a social insect that relies on altruism to protect the entire colony. When a worker ant's leg is grasped, it suicidally expels the contents of its hypertrophied glands, expelling corrosive irritant compounds and adhesives onto the predator. This prevents predation and serves as a signal to other enemy ants to stop predation of the rest of the colony.\n* Some ant-loving caterpillars are herded by ants to feeding areas during the day and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland that secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Other caterpillars", "Of course!

In the American version, which incorporated a battery for saved games rather than the password system of the original, talking to the king also allows for the deletion and moving of saved games.\nThroughout the game, visiting certain individuals in towns will activate optional events and side quests. Prisons, sewers, forests, and story-centric locations serve as dungeon locales; these areas are scattered with treasure chests containing rare items, some of which cannot be purchased in stores. Dungeons frequently contain puzzles and mazes, such as", "Of course, I'd be happy to provide more information about Maya Angelou's international recognition and acclaim.\nMaya Angelou's autobiographies brought her international recognition and acclaim. Her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, was published in 1969 and became an instant bestseller. The book was praised for its vivid depiction of Angelou's childhood experiences and its exploration of themes such as race, identity, and sexuality. The book was also notable for its episodic structure, which was uncommon in autobiographies at the time.\nAngelou subsequently wrote six additional autobiographies, covering a variety of her young adult experiences. They are distinct in style and narration, but unified in their themes and stretch from Arkansas to Africa and back to the US, from the beginnings of World War II to King's assassination. Like Caged Bird, the events in these books are episodic and crafted as a series of short stories, yet do not follow a strict chronology.\nLater books in the series include Gather Together in My Name (197", "Sure!

Southey did find a publisher, Joseph Cottle, to print his poem. A notification for the publication of Joan of Arc was included in a publication of Southey's poems later in 1794, but the edition was stopped from being printed since it lacked the minimum of 50 subscribers to pay for the cost. The poem was finally published by Cottle in 1796 (see 1796 in poetry) after changes to the text, including a section added by Coleridge. The second edition would later be printed without Coleridge's lines, and they were instead published on their own. For the second edition, Southey revised many lines and added more research to the work. It was printed in May 1798.

Traditional fishing methods, such as wade netting for salmon, remained in place for thousands of years. Welsh coracles, simple boats made of a willow frame and covered in animal hides, were noted by Romans and were still in use in the 20th century. Once landed, fish would generally be wind-dried and smoked, or cured with salt. Herring, a fish that takes well to salting, became a well-established catch; the busiest harbor was Aberystwyth, which reportedly took up to 1,000 barrels of herring in a single night in 1724. Many other villages also fished for herring, generally between late August and December. Herring, along with mackerel, trout, salmon, and sea trout, were the main fishes found in Welsh cuisine. Salmon was abundant and therefore a staple for the poor. Trout, which would dry out quickly when cooked, would be wrapped in leek leaves for cook", "Certainly!

As a result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues, including the need for relationship-building by the assignment of a child to a specific caregiver. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to provide this, more infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than in the past.

The bronze statues of prominent citizens that stood on brackets on the main columns of the Capitol in Washington, D.C. were a source of controversy in the late 19th century. The committees in charge of constructing the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty faced significant difficulties in raising funds, as the Panic of 1873 had led to an economic depression that persisted throughout the decade. The Liberty statue project was not the only one that faced financial difficulties; the construction of the Washington Monument also experienced delays due to a lack of funds.\nThere was criticism of both the Statue of Liberty and the fact that Americans were footing the bill for the pedestal. Many Americans preferred more realistic artworks that depicted heroes and events from the nation's history, rather than allegorical works like the Liberty statue. Additionally, there was a sense that American public works should be designed by Americans, as the selection of an Italian-born artist to decorate the Capitol had provoked intense criticism, even though he was a naturalized U.S. citizen.\nFaced with these criticisms, the committees", "Certainly!

In the context of Irish phonology, \"palatalized\" refers to the way the tongue moves during the articulation of certain consonants. Specifically, it means that the tongue is pushed up toward the hard palate, which is the front part of the roof of the mouth. This is in contrast to \"velarized\" consonants, which are articulated with the back of the tongue pushed back and up toward the soft palate. The contrast between palatalized and velarized consonants is important in Irish because it can affect the way the surrounding vowels are pronounced, as well as the way certain consonants can or cannot appear next to each other in a word. For example, the word \"beo\" (meaning \"alive\") has a slender \"b\" sound because the tongue is pushed up toward the hard palate during its articulation.

The project, known as the AFVG (Anglo-French Variable Geometry) aircraft, was a collaborative effort between the United Kingdom and France. The design was intended to provide a versatile fighter-bomber capable of performing a wide range of missions, including air-to-air combat, air-to-ground strikes, and reconnaissance.\nThe AFVG design featured a variable geometry wing, which could be swept from 20 to 60 degrees. This allowed the aircraft to achieve high speeds during air-to-air combat, while also providing the ability to perform low-level reconnaissance and ground attacks. The aircraft was also designed with a modular avionics system, which could be easily updated to accommodate new technology and changing mission requirements.\nThe project was initially funded by the UK and France, but due to budget constraints and the cancellation of the AFVG program, the project was eventually abandoned.

Bradley Jr. is an economist who has written extensively on the topic of resource scarcity and the Austrian school of economics. In his 2007 article \"The Scarcity of Mineral Resources: An Austrian Perspective,\" which was published in The Review of Austrian Economics, Bradley argues that the concept of resource scarcity is more complex than neoclassical economists typically acknowledge.\nBradley begins by noting that neoclassical economists tend to view resources as if they were homogeneous and interchangeable, rather than as unique and heterogeneous entities. This perspective, he argues, leads neoclassical economists to underestimate the scarcity of certain resources, particularly those that are difficult or expensive to extract or process.\nBradley then turns to the Austrian school of economics, which he argues offers a more nuanced and realistic perspective on resource scarcity. According to Austrian economists, resources are not fixed or infinite, but rather subjective and dependent on the actions of individuals and firms. In other words, the scarcity of resources is not a function of their objective properties, but rather of", "Certainly!

Brown stated that he would not change the game of football to accommodate the AP poll, which he believes has too much influence over the sport.\nBrown's comments were likely made in response to the AP poll's tendency to rank teams based solely on their win-loss record, without taking into account other factors such as strength of schedule or quality of opponents.

Hackett reconvened with the remaining group members in July 1975 and Banks and Rutherford were particularly keen to write and record new material so that critics and fans would accept Gabriel's departure . The group began rehearsals in a basement studio in Acton and quickly wrote material they were happy with but had not yet found a replacement lead singer . They placed an anonymous advertisement in the music paper Melody Maker for \" a singer for a Genesis-type group \" which received around 400 replies . Some applicants sent photographs of themselves in costume and wearing masks as Gabriel had done on stage . A few weeks into rehearsals , Melody Maker managed to find out about Gabriel leaving the band and their story made the front page of the 16 August issue , where journalist Chris Welch declared Genesis dead . The group spoke to the music papers", "Certainly! In English, the indirect object can come before or after the direct object, depending on the type of preposition used. Here are some examples:\n* Before the direct object:\nIndirect object: John gave the book to Mary. (Here, \"to\" is an indirect object preposition, and it comes before the direct object \"book\".)\n* After the direct object:\nIndirect object: Mary received the book from John. (Here, \"from\" is an indirect object preposition, and it comes after the direct object \"book\".)\nIn general, if the preposition is a \"to\" preposition (such as \"to\", \"from\", \"for\", \"with\"), the indirect object usually comes before the direct object. However, if the preposition is a \"at\" or \"in\" preposition (such as \"at\", \"in\", \"on\"), the indirect object usually comes after the direct object.\nI hope this helps clarify the relationship between indirect objects and direct objects in English! Let me know if you have any other questions.", "Certainly! Here is the context you requested:\ncontext: On 15 October 1917, the United States Shipping Board (USSB) requisitioned all American passenger ships over 2,500 GT for use by the government in the war effort. Though it is not clear what immediate impact this had on Kroonland, it is known that the liner was operating as a U.S. Army transport (under the name USAT Kroonland) by February 1918, when she was loaded with materiel and departed New York for Saint-Nazaire, France.\nIn February 1918, the USSB assigned Kroonland to the transport fleet as an U.S. Army Chartered Transport, and after her return from France on 9 April, she was converted to a troop transport in New York by the William J. Kennedy Company. A typical conversion from passenger liner to troop transport involved having all of the second- and third-class accommodations ripped out and replaced with berths for troops. Cooking and toilet facilities also had to be greatly expanded to handle the large numbers of men aboard.", "Certainly!
