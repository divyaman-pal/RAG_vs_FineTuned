The disease is caused by the buildup of two types of proteins in the brain: beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles. These proteins disrupt communication between brain cells and eventually lead to cell death, causing cognitive decline and memory loss.\nAs a carrier of the APOE gene, which is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, you may be at a higher risk of developing the disease. However, it is important to note that not everyone with the APOE gene will develop Alzheimer's, and there are many other factors that can contribute to the development of the disease.\nIf you are experiencing early symptoms of Alzheimer's, such as disorganization in certain areas, irritability with noise, and difficulty remembering recent events, it is important to consult with a neurologist as soon as possible.
